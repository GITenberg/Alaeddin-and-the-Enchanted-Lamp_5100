     My Dear Burton,

     I give myself the pleasure of placing your name in the forefront
     of another and final volume of my translation of the Thousand and
     One Nights, which, if it have brought me no other good, has at
     least been the means of procuring me your friendship.

        Twelve years this day,&mdash;a day of winter, dreary
      With drifting snows, when all the world seemed dead
        To Spring and hope,&mdash;it is since, worn and weary
           Of doubt within and strife without, I fled

          From the mean workday miseries of existence,
       From spites that slander and from hates that lie,
            Into the dreamland of the Orient distance
            Under the splendours of the Syrian sky,

         And in the enchanted realms of Eastern story,
           Far from the lovelessness of modern times,

           Garnered the rainbow-remnants of old glory
           That linger yet in those ancestral climes;

         And now, the tong task done, the journey over,
            From that far home of immemorial calms,
           Where, as a mirage, on the sky-marge hover
               The desert and its oases of palms,

          Lingering, I turn me back, with eyes reverted
             To this stepmother world of daily life,
          As one by some long pleasant dream deserted,
            That wakes anew to dull unlovely strife:

       Yet, if non' other weal the quest have wrought me.
               The long beloved labour now at end,
    This gift of gifts the untravelled East hath brought me,
            The knowledge of a new and valued friend.

      INTRODUCTION.

    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The readers of my translation of the Book of the Thousand Nights and One
      Night will remember that, in the terminal essay (1884) on the history and
      character of the collection, I expressed my conviction that the eleven
      (so-called) "interpolated" tales, <a href="#linknote-1"
      name="linknoteref-1" id="linknoteref-1"><small>1</small></a> though, in my
      judgment, genuine Oriental stories, had (with the exception of the Sleeper
      Awakened and Aladdin) no connection with the original work, but had been
      procured by Galland from various (as yet) unidentified sources, for the
      purpose of supplying the deficiencies of the imperfect MS. of the Nights
      from which he made his version. <a href="#linknote-2" name="linknoteref-2"
      id="linknoteref-2"><small>2</small></a> My opinion as to these talcs has
      now been completely confirmed by the recent discovery (by M. Zotenberg,
      Keeper of Oriental MSS. in the Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris) of two
      Arabic MSS. of the Nights, both containing three of the missing stories,
      i.e. (1) Zeyn Alasnam, (3) The Sleeper Awakened and (4) Aladdin, and by
      the publication (also by M. Zotenberg) of certain extracts from Galland's
      diary, giving particulars of the circumstances under which the
      "interpolated" tales were incorporated with his translation of the Arabian
      Nights. The Arabic text of the Story of Aladdin, as given by the completer
      and more authentic of the newly-discovered MSS., has recently been made by
      M. Zotenberg the subject of a special publication, <a href="#linknote-3"
      name="linknoteref-3" id="linknoteref-3"><small>3</small></a> in the
      preface to which (an exhaustive bibliographical essay upon the various
      Texts of the Thousand and One Nights, considered in relation to Galland's
      translation) he gives, in addition to the extracts in question from
      Galland's Diary, a detailed description of the two MSS. aforesaid, the
      more interesting particulars of which I now proceed to abstract for the
      benefit of my readers.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                              II.
</pre>
    <p>
      The first MS. commences precisely where the third volume of Galland's MS.
      ends, to wit, (see my Terminal essay, p. 265, note1) with the 281st Night,
      in the middle of the story of Camaralzaman <a href="#linknote-4"
      name="linknoteref-4" id="linknoteref-4"><small>4</small></a> and contains,
      (inter alia) besides the continuation of this latter (which ends with
      Night CCCXXIX), the stories of the Sleeper Awakened (Nights CCCXXX-CCCC),
      Ganem (Nights CCCCXXVIII-CCCCLXX1V), Zeyn Alasnam (Nights
      CCCCLXXV-CCCCXCI), Aladdin (Nights CCCCXCII-DLXIX) and three others not
      found in Galland's version. The MS. ends in the middle of the 631st night
      with the well-known Story of King Bekhtzad (Azadbekht) and his son or the
      Ten Viziers, (which will be found translated in my "Tales from the
      Arabic," Vol. I. pp. 61 et seq.) and contains, immediately after Night
      CCCCXXVII and before the story of Ganem, a note in Arabic, of which the
      following is a translation:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fourth volume of the wonders and marvels of the stories of the
      Thousand Nights and One Night was finished by the hand of the humblest of
      His' servants in the habit of a minister of religion (Kahin, lit. a
      diviner, Cohen), the [Christian] priest Dionysius Shawish, a scion (selil)
      of the College of the Romans (Greeks, Europeans or Franks, er Roum), by
      name St. Athanasius, in Rome the Greatest <a href="#linknote-5"
      name="linknoteref-5" id="linknoteref-5"><small>5</small></a> (or Greater,
      utsma, fem. of aatsem, qu re Constantinople?) on the seven-and-twentieth
      of the month Shubat (February) of the year one thousand seven hundred
      fourscore and seven, [he being] then teacher of the Arabic tongue in the
      Library of the Sultan, King of France, at Paris the Greatest."
    </p>
    <p>
      From this somewhat incoherent note we may assume that the MS. was written
      in the course of the year 1787 by the notorious Syrian ecclesiastic Dom
      Denis Chavis, the accomplice of Cazotte in the extraordinary literary
      atrocity shortly afterward perpetrated by the latter under the name of a
      sequel or continuation of the Thousand and One Nights <a href="#linknote-6"
      name="linknoteref-6" id="linknoteref-6"><small>6</small></a> (v. Cabinet
      des Fees, vols. xxxviii&mdash;xli), <a href="#linknote-7"
      name="linknoteref-7" id="linknoteref-7"><small>7</small></a> and in all
      probability (cf. the mention in the above note of the first part, i.e.
      Nights CCLXXXI-CCCCXXVII, as the fourth volume) to supply the place of
      Galland's missing fourth volume for the Bibliotheque Royale; but there. is
      nothing, except a general similarity of style and the occurrence in the
      former of the rest of Camaralzaman and (though not in the same order) of
      four of the tales supposed to have been contained in the latter, to show
      that Dom Chavis made his copy from a text identical with that used by the
      French savant. In the notes to his edition of the Arabic text of Aladdin,
      M. Zotenberg gives a number of extracts from this MS., from which it
      appears that it is written in a very vulgar modern Syrian style and
      abounds in grammatical errors, inconsistencies and incoherences of every
      description, to say nothing of the fact that the Syrian ecclesiastic
      seems, with the characteristic want of taste and presumption which might
      be expected from the joint-author of "Les Veillees Persanes," to have, to
      a considerable extent, garbled the original text by the introduction of
      modern European phrases and turns of speech a la Galland. For the rest,
      the MS. contains no note or other indication, on which we can found any
      opinion as to the source from which the transcriber (or arranger) drew his
      materials; but it can hardly be doubted, from internal evidence, that he
      had the command of some genuine text of the Nights, similar to, if not
      identical with, that of Galland, which he probably "arranged" to suit his
      own (and his century's) distorted ideas of literary fitness. The discovery
      of the interpolated tales contained in this MS. (which has thus presumably
      lain unnoticed for a whole century, under, as one may say, the very noses
      of the many students of Arabic literature who would have rejoiced in such
      a find) has, by a curious freak of fortune, been delayed until our own day
      in consequence of a singular mistake made by a former conservator of the
      Paris Bibliotheque, the well-known Orientalist, M. Reinaud, who, in
      drawing up the Catalogue of the Arabic MSS. in the collection described
      (or rather misdescribed) it under the following heading:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supplement Arabe 1716. Thousand and One Nights, 3rd and 4th parts. This
      volume begins with Night CCLXXXII and ends with Night DCXXXI. A copy in
      the handwriting of Chavis. It is from this copy and in accordance with the
      instructions (d'apres la indications) of this Syrian monk that Cazotte
      composed (redigea) the Sequel to the Thousand and One Nights, Cabinet des
      Fees, xxxvii et xl (should be tt. xxxviii-xli)."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is of course evident that M. Reinaud had never read the MS. in question
      nor that numbered 1723 in the Supplement Arabe, or he would at once have
      recognized that the latter, though not in the handwriting of the Syrian
      ecclesiastic, was that which served for the production of the "Sequel" in
      question; but, superficial as was the mistake, it sufficed to prevent the
      examination by students of the MS. No. 1716 and so retarded the discovery
      of the Arabic originals of Aladdin and its fellows till the acquisition
      (some two years ago) by the Bibliotheque Nationale of another (and
      complete) MS. of the Thousand and One Nights, which appears to have
      belonged to the celebrated Orientalist M. Caussin de Perceval, although
      the latter could not have been acquainted with it at the time (1806) he
      published his well-known edition and continuation of Galland's
      translation, in the eighth and ninth volumes of which, by the by, he gives
      a correct version of the tales so fearfully garbled by Chavis and Cazotte
      in their so-called translation as well nigh to defy recognition and to
      cause Orientalists in general to deny the possibility of their having been
      derived from an Oriental source until the discovery of the actual Arabic
      originals so barbarously maltreated <a href="#linknote-8"
      name="linknoteref-8" id="linknoteref-8"><small>8</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      This MS. is in the handwriting of of Sebbagh, the well-known Syrian
      collaborator of Silvestre de Sacy, and is supposed to have been copied by
      him at Paris between the years 1805 and 1810 for some European Orientalist
      (probably de Perceval himself) from a Baghdad MS. of the early part of the
      18th century, of which it professes to be an exact reproduction, as
      appears from a terminal note, of which the following is a translation:
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the finishing of it was in the first tenth (decade) of Jumada the
      Latter [in the] year one thousand one hundred and fifteen of the Hegira
      (October, 1703) in the handwriting of the neediest of the faithful <a
      href="#linknote-9" name="linknoteref-9" id="linknoteref-9"><small>9</small></a>
      unto God <a href="#linknote-10" name="linknoteref-10" id="linknoteref-10"><small>10</small></a>
      the Most High, Ahmed ibn Mohammed et Teradi, in the city of Baghdad, and
      he the Shafiy by sect and the Mosuli by birth and the Baghdadi by sojourn,
      and indeed he wrote it for himself and set upon it his seal, and God bless
      and keep our lord Mohammed and his companions! Kebikej <a
      href="#linknote-11" name="linknoteref-11" id="linknoteref-11"><small>11</small></a>
      (ter)."
    </p>
    <p>
      This MS. contains the three "interpolated" tales aforesaid, i.e. the
      Sleeper Awakened (Nights CCCXXXVII-LXXXVI), Zeyn Alasnam (Nights
      CCCCXCVII-DXIII) and Aladdin (Nights DXIV-XCI), the last two bearing
      traces of a Syrian origin, especially Aladdin, which is written in a much
      commoner and looser style than Zeyn Alasnam. The two tales are evidently
      the work of different authors, Zeyn Alasnam being incomparably superior in
      style and correctness to Aladdin, which is defaced by all kinds of
      vulgarisms and solecisms and seems, moreover, to have been less correctly
      copied than the other. Nevertheless, the Sebbagh text is in every respect
      preferable to that of Shawish (which appears to abound in faults and
      errors of every kind, general and particular,) and M. Zotenberg has,
      therefore, exercised a wise discretion in selecting the former for
      publication.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                              III.
</pre>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most noteworthy feature of M. Zorenberg's long and interesting
      introduction is a series of extracts from the (as yet unpublished) MS.
      Diary regularly kept by Galland, the last four volumes (1708-15) of which
      are preserved in the Bibliotheque Nationale. These extracts effectually
      settle the question of the origin of the interpolated tales, as will be
      seen from the following abstract.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 25th March, 1709, Galland records having that day made the
      acquaintance of a Maronite scholar, by name Youhenna Diab, <a
      href="#linknote-12" name="linknoteref-12" id="linknoteref-12"><small>12</small></a>
      who had been brought from Aleppo to Paris by Paul Lucas, the celebrated
      traveller, and with whom he evidently at once broached the question of the
      Nights, <a href="#linknote-13" name="linknoteref-13" id="linknoteref-13"><small>13</small></a>
      probably complaining to him of the difficulty (or rather impossibility) of
      obtaining a perfect copy of the work; whereupon Hanna (as he always calls
      him) appears to have volunteered to help him to fill the lacune by
      furnishing him with suitable Oriental stories for translation in the same
      style as those already rendered by him and then and there (says Galland)
      "told me some very fine Arabian tales, which he promised to put into
      writing for me." There is no fresh entry on the subject till May 5
      following, when (says Galland) "The Maronite Hanna finished telling me the
      tale of the Lamp." <a href="#linknote-14" name="linknoteref-14"
      id="linknoteref-14"><small>14</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hanna appears to have remained in Paris till the autumn of the year 1709
      and during his stay, Galland's Diary records the communication by him to
      the French savant of the following stories, afterwards included in the
      ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth volumes of the latter's translation,
      (as well as of several others which he probably intended to translate, had
      he lived,) <a href="#linknote-15" name="linknoteref-15" id="linknoteref-15"><small>15</small></a>
      i.e. (May 10, 1709) "Babe Abdalla" and "Sidi Nouman," (May 13, 1709) "The
      Enchanted Horse," (May 22, 1709) "Prince Ahmed and Pari Banou," (May 25,
      1709) "The Two Sisters who envied their younger Sister," (May 27, 1709)
      "All Baba and the Forty Thieves," (May 29, 1709) "Cogia Hassan Alhabbal"
      and (May 31, 1709) "Ali Cogia." The Maronite seems to have left for the
      East in October, 1709, (Galland says under date October 25, "Received this
      evening a letter from Hanna, who writes me from Marseilles, under date the
      17th, in Arabic, to the effect that he had arrived there in good health,")
      but not without having at least in part fulfilled his promise to put in
      writing the tales communicated by him to Galland, as appears by the entry
      of November 3, 1710, "Began yesterday to read the Arabian story of the
      Lamp, which had been written me in Arabic more than a year ago by the
      Maronite of Damascus <a href="#linknote-16" name="linknoteref-16"
      id="linknoteref-16"><small>16</small></a> whom M. Lucas brought with him,
      with a view to putting it into French. Finished reading it this morning.
      Here is the title of this tale, 'Story of Aladdin, son of a tailor, and
      that which befell him with an African Magician on account of (or through)
      a lamp.'" (The Diary adds that he began that evening to put his
      translation into writing and finished it in the course of the ensuing
      fortnight.) And that of January 10, 1711, "Finished the translation of the
      tenth volume of the 1001 Nights after the Arabic text which I had from the
      hand (de la main) of Hanna or Jean Dipi, <a href="#linknote-17"
      name="linknoteref-17" id="linknoteref-17"><small>17</small></a> whom M.
      Lucas brought to France on his return from his last journey in the
      Levant." The only other entry bearing upon the question is that of August
      24, 1711, in which Galland says, "Being quit of my labours upon the
      translation etc. of the Koran, I read a part of the Arabian Tales which
      the Maronite Hanna had told me and which I had summarily reduced to
      writing, to see which of them I should select to make up the eleventh
      volume of the Thousand and One Nights."
    </p>
    <p>
      From these entries it appears beyond question that Galland received from
      the Maronite Hanna, in the Spring and Summer of 1709, the Arabic text of
      the stories of Aladdin, Baba Abdalla, Sidi Nouman and Cogia Hassan
      Alhabbal, i.e. the whole of the tales included in his ninth and tenth
      volumes (with the exception of The Sleeper Awakened, of which he does not
      speak) and that he composed the five remaining tales contained in his
      eleventh and twelfth volumes (i.e. Ali Baba, Ali Cogia, The Enchanted
      Horse, Prince Ahmed and Pari Banou and The Two Sisters who envied their
      younger Sister,) upon the details thereof taken down from Hanna's lips and
      by the aid of copious summaries made at the time. These entries in
      Galland's diary dispose, therefore, of the question of the origin of the
      "interpolated" tales, with the exception (1) of The Sleeper Awakened (with
      which we need not, for the present, concern ourselves farther) and (2) of
      Nos. 1 and 2a and b, i.e. Zeyn Alasnam, Codadad and his brothers and The
      Princess of Deryabar (forming, with Ganem, his eighth volume), as to which
      Galland, as I pointed out in my terminal essay (p. 264), cautions us, in a
      prefatory note to his ninth volume, that these two stories form no part of
      the Thousand and One Nights and that they had been inserted and printed
      without the cognizance of the translator, who was unaware of the trick
      that had been played him till after the actual publication of the volume,
      adding that care would be taken to expunge the intrusive tales from the
      second edition (which, however, was never done, Galland dying before the
      republication and it being probably found that the stranger tales had
      taken too firm a hold upon public favour to be sacrificed, as originally
      proposed); and the invaluable Diary supplies the necessary supplemental
      information as to their origin. "M. Petis de la Croix," says Galland under
      date of January 17, 1710, "Professor and King's Reader of the Arabic
      tongue, who did me the honour to visit me this morning, was extremely
      surprised to see two of the Turkish <a href="#linknote-18"
      name="linknoteref-18" id="linknoteref-18"><small>18</small></a> Tales of
      his translation printed in the eighth volume of the 1001 Nights, which I
      showed him, and that this should have been done without his
      participation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Petis de la Croix, a well-known Orientalist and traveller of the time,
      published in the course of the same year (1710) the first volume of a
      collection of Oriental stories, similar in form and character to the 1001
      Nights, but divided into "Days" instead of "Nights" and called "The
      Thousand and One Days, Persian Tales," the preface to which (ascribed to
      Cazotte) alleges him to have translated the tales from a Persian work
      called Hezar [o] Yek Roz, i.e. "The Thousand and One Days," the MS. of
      which had in 1675 been communicated to the translator by a friend of his,
      by name Mukhlis, (Cazotte styles him "the celebrated Dervish Mocles, chief
      of the Soufis of Ispahan") during his sojourn in the Persian capital. The
      preface goes on to state that Mukhlis had, in his youth, translated into
      Persian certain Indian plays, which had been translated into all the
      Oriental languages and of which a Turkish version existed in the
      Bibliotheque Royale, under the title of Alfaraga Badal-Schidda (i.e. El
      Ferej bad esh Shiddeh), which signified "Joy after Affliction"; but that,
      wishing to give his work an original air, he converted the aforesaid plays
      into tales. Cazotte's story of the Indian plays savours somewhat of the
      cock and the bull and it is probable that the Hezar o Yek Roz (which is
      not, to my knowledge, extant) was not derived from so recondite a source,
      but was itself either the original of the well-known Turkish collection or
      (perhaps) a translation of the latter. At all events, Zeyn Alasnam,
      Codadad and the Princess of Deryabar occur in a copy (cited by M.
      Zotenberg), belonging to the Bibliotheque Nationale, of El Ferej bad esh
      Shidded (of which they form the eighth, ninth and sixth stories
      respectively) and in a practically identical form, except that in
      Galland's vol. viii. the two latter stories are fused into one. Sir
      William Ouseley is said to have brought from Persia a MS. copy of a
      portion of the Hezar o Yek Roz which he describes as agreeing with the
      French version, but, in the absence of documentary proof and in view of
      the fact that, notwithstanding the unauthorized incorporation of three of
      the tales of his original with Galland's Vol. viii, the published version
      of the Thousand and One Days is apparently complete and shows no trace of
      the omission, I am inclined to suspect Petis de la Croix of having
      invented the division into Days, in order to imitate (and profit by the
      popularity of) his fellow savant's version of the Thousand and One Nights.
      Galland's publisher was doubtless also that of Petis de la Croix and in
      the latter capacity had in hand a portion of the MS. of the 1001 Days,
      from which, no doubt weary of waiting till Galland (who was now come to
      the end of his genuine Arabic MS. of the 1001 Nights and was accordingly
      at a standstill, till he met with Hanna,) should have procured fresh
      material to complete the copy for his eighth volume, of which Ganem only
      was then ready for publication, he seems to have selected (apparently on
      his own responsibility, but, it must be admitted, with considerable taste
      and judgment,) the three tales in question from the MS. of the 1001 Days,
      to fill up the lacune. It does not appear whether he found Codadad and the
      Princess of Deryabar arranged as one story ready to his hand or himself
      performed (or procured to be performed) the process of fusion, which, in
      any case, was executed by no unskilful hand. Be this as it may, Galland
      was naturally excessively annoyed at the publisher's unceremonious
      proceeding, so much so indeed as for a time to contemplate renouncing the
      publication of the rest of the work, to spare himself (as he says in his
      Diary, under date of Dec. 12, 1709) similar annoyances (mortifications) to
      that which the printing of the eighth volume had caused him. Indeed, the
      effect of this incident was to induce him, not only to change his
      publisher, but to delay the publication of the next volume (which, as we
      learn from the Diary, was ready for the press at the end of November or
      the beginning of December, 1709) for a whole year, at the end of which
      time (Diary, November 21, 1710) he made arrangements with a new (and
      presumably more trustworthy) publisher, M. Florentin de Laune, for the
      printing of Vol. ix.

    <p>
      Notwithstanding the discovery, as above set out, of three of the doubtful
      tales, Zeyn Alasnam, Aladdin and The Sleeper Awakened, in two MSS. (one at
      least undoubtedly authentic) of the Thousand Nights and One Night, I am
      more than ever of opinion that none of the eleven "interpolated" stories
      properly belongs to the original work, that is to say, to the collection
      as first put into definite form somewhere about the fourteenth century. <a
      href="#linknote-19" name="linknoteref-19" id="linknoteref-19"><small>19</small></a>
      "The Sleeper Awakened" was identified by the late Mr. Lane as a historical
      anecdote given by the historian El Ishaki, who wrote in the first quarter
      of the seventeenth century, and the frequent mention of coffee in both
      MSS. of Aladdin justifies us in attributing the composition of the story
      to (at earliest) the sixteenth century, whilst the modern vulgarisms in
      which they abound point to a still later date. Zeyn Alasnam (in the
      Sebbagh MS. at least) is written in a much purer and more scholarly style
      than Aladdin, but its pre-existence in El Ferej bad esh Shiddeh (even if
      we treat as apocryphal Petis de la Croix's account of the Hezar o Yek Roz)
      is sufficient, in the absence of contrary evidence, to justify us in
      refusing to consider it as belonging to the Thousand Nights and One Night
      proper. As shown by Galland's own experience, complete copies of the
      genuine work were rarely to be met with, collections of "silly stories"
      (as the Oriental savant, who inclines to regard nothing in the way of
      literature save theology, grammar and poetry, would style them), being
      generally considered by the Arab bibliographer undeserving of record or
      preservation, and the fragmentary copies which existed were mostly in the
      hands of professional story-tellers, who were extremely unwilling to part
      with them, looking upon them as their stock in trade, and were in the
      habit of incorporating with the genuine text all kinds of stories and
      anecdotes from other sources, to fill the place of the missing portions of
      the original work. This process of addition and incorporation, which has
      been in progress ever since the first collection of the Nights into one
      distinct work and is doubtless still going on in Oriental countries,
      (especially such as are least in contact with European influence,) may
      account for the heterogeneous character of the various modern MSS. of the
      Nights and for the immense difference which exists between the several
      texts, as well in actual contents as in the details and diction of such
      stories as are common to all. The Tunis MS. of the 1001 Nights (which is
      preserved in the Breslau University Library and which formed the principal
      foundation of Habicht's Edition of the Arabic text) affords a striking
      example of this process, which we are here enabled to see in
      mid-operation, the greater part of the tales of which it consists having
      not yet been adapted to the framework of the Nights. It is dated A.H. 1144
      (A.D. 1732) and of the ten volumes of which it consists, i, ii (Nights I&mdash;CCL)
      and x (Nights DCCCLXXXV-MI) are alone divided into Nights, the division of
      the remaining seven volumes (i.e. iii&mdash;ix, containing, inter alia,
      the Story of the Sleeper Awakened) being the work of the German editor. It
      is my belief, therefore, that the three "interpolated" tales identified as
      forming part of the Baghdad MS. of 1703 are comparatively modern stories
      added to the genuine text by Rawis (story-tellers) or professional writers
      employed by them, and I see no reason to doubt that we shall yet discover
      the Arabic text of the remaining eight, either in Hanna's version (as
      written down for Galland) or in some as yet unexamined MS. of the Nights
      or other work of like character.

      M. Zotenberg has, with great judgment, taken as his standard for
      publication the text of Aladdin given by the Sebbagh MS., inasmuch as the
      Shawish MS. (besides being, as appears from the extracts given. <a
      href="#linknote-20" name="linknoteref-20" id="linknoteref-20"><small>20</small></a>
      far inferior both in style and general correctness,) is shown by the
      editor to be full of modern European phrases and turns of speech and to
      present so many suspicious peculiarities that it would be difficult,
      having regard, moreover, to the doubtful character and reputation of the
      Syrian monkish adventurer who styled himself Dom Denis Chavis, to resist
      the conviction that his MS. was a forgery, i.e. professedly a copy of a
      genuine Arabic text, but in reality only a translation or paraphrase in
      that language of Galland's version,&mdash;were it not that the Baghdad MS.
      (dated before the commencement, in 1704, of Galland's publication and
      transcribed by a man&mdash;Mikhail Sebbagh&mdash;whose reputation, as a
      collaborator of Silvestre de Sacy and other distinguished Orientalists, is
      a sufficient voucher for the authenticity of the copy in the Bibliotheque
      Nationale,) contains a text essentially identical with that of Shawish.
      Moreover, it is evident, from a comparison with Galland's rendering and
      making allowance for the latter's system of translation, that the Arabic
      version of Aladdin given him by Hanna must either have been derived from
      the Baghdad text or from some other practically identical source, and it
      is therefore probable that Shawish, having apparently been employed to
      make up the missing portion of Galland's Arabic text and not having the
      Hanna MS. at his command, had (with the execrable taste and want of
      literary morality which distinguished Cazotte's monkish coadjutor)
      endeavoured to bring his available text up to what he considered the
      requisite standard by modernizing and Gallicizing its wording and (in
      particular) introducing numerous European phrases and turns of speech in
      imitation of the French translator. The whole question is, of course, as
      yet a matter of more or less probable hypothesis, and so it must remain
      until further discoveries and especially until the reappearance of
      Galland's missing text, which I am convinced must exist in some shape or
      other and cannot much longer, in the face of the revived interest awakened
      in the matter and the systematic process of investigation now likely to be
      employed, elude research.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Zotenberg's publication having been confined to the text of Aladdin, I
      have to thank my friend Sir R. F. Burton for the loan of his MS. copy of
      Zeyn Alasnam, (the Arabic text of which still remains unpublished) as
      transcribed by M. Houdas from the Sebbagh MS.

    <h2>
      ZEIN UL ASNAM AND THE KING OF THE JINN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There <a href="#linknote-21" name="linknoteref-21" id="linknoteref-21"><small>21</small></a>
      was [once] in the city of Bassora a mighty Sultan and he was exceeding
      rich, but he had no child who should be his successor <a
      href="#linknote-22" name="linknoteref-22" id="linknoteref-22"><small>22</small></a>
      after him. For this he grieved sore and fell to bestowing alms galore upon
      the poor and the needy and upon the friends <a href="#linknote-23"
      name="linknoteref-23" id="linknoteref-23"><small>23</small></a> of God and
      the devout, seeking their intercession with God the Most High, so He to
      whom belong might and majesty should of His favour vouchsafe him a son.
      And God accepted his prayer, for his fostering of the poor, and answered
      his petition; so that one night of the nights he lay with the queen and
      she went from him with child. When the Sultan knew this, he rejoiced with
      an exceeding joy, and as the time of her child-bearing drew nigh, he
      assembled all the astrologers and those who smote the sand <a
      href="#linknote-24" name="linknoteref-24" id="linknoteref-24"><small>24</small></a>
      and said to them, "It is my will that ye enquire concerning the child that
      shall be born to me this month, whether it will be male or female, and
      tell me what will betide it of chances and what will proceed from it." <a
      href="#linknote-25" name="linknoteref-25" id="linknoteref-25"><small>25</small></a>
      So the geomancers smote their [tables of] sand and the astrologers took
      their altitudes <a href="#linknote-26" name="linknoteref-26"
      id="linknoteref-26"><small>26</small></a> and observed the star of the
      babe [un]born and said to the Sultan, "O King of the age and lord of the
      time and the tide, the child that shall be born to thee of the queen is a
      male and it beseemeth that thou name him Zein ul Asnam." <a
      href="#linknote-27" name="linknoteref-27" id="linknoteref-27"><small>27</small></a>
      And as for those who smote upon the sand, they said to him, "Know, O King,
      that this babe will become a renowned brave, <a href="#linknote-28"
      name="linknoteref-28" id="linknoteref-28"><small>28</small></a> but he
      shall happen in his time upon certain travail and tribulation; yet, an he
      endure with fortitude against that which shall befall him, he shall become
      the richest of the kings of the world." And the King said to them, "Since
      the babe shall become valiant as ye avouch, the toil and travail which
      will befall him are nought, for that tribulations teach the sons of
      kings."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Accordingly, after a few days, the queen gave birth to a male child,
extolled be the perfection of Him who created him surpassing in grace
and goodliness! His father named him Zein ul Asnam, and he was as say of
him certain of his praisers <a href="#linknote-29" name="linknoteref-29"
      id="linknoteref-29">29</a> in verse: <a href="#linknote-30"
      name="linknoteref-30" id="linknoteref-30">30</a>

 He shows and "Now Allah be blessed!" men say: "Extol we his Maker
      and Fashioner aye!
 The king of the fair <a href="#linknote-31" name="linknoteref-31"
      id="linknoteref-31">31</a> this is, sure, one and all; Ay, his thralls,
      every one, and his liegemen are they."
</pre>
    <p>
      The boy grew and flourished till he came to the age of five <a
      href="#linknote-32" name="linknoteref-32" id="linknoteref-32"><small>32</small></a>
      years, when his father the Sultan assigned him a governor skilled and
      versed in all sciences and philosophies, and he proceeded to teach him
      till he excelled in all manner of knowledge and became a young man. <a
      href="#linknote-33" name="linknoteref-33" id="linknoteref-33"><small>33</small></a>
      Then the Sultan bade bring him before himself, and assembling all the
      grandees of his realm and the chiefs of his subjects, proceeded to
      admonish him before them, saying to him, "O my son Zein ul Asnam, behold,
      I am grown stricken in years and am presently sick; and belike this
      sickness will be the last of my life in this world and thou shalt sit in
      my stead; [wherefore I desire to admonish thee]. Beware, O my son, lest
      thou oppress any or turn a deaf ear to the complaining of the poor; but do
      thou justify the oppressed after the measure of thy might. And look thou
      believe not all that shall be said to thee by the great ones of the
      people, but trust thou still for the most part to the voice of the common
      folk; for the great will deceive thee, seeing they seek that which
      befitteth themselves, not that which befitteth the subject." Then, after a
      few days, the Sultan's sickness redoubled on him and he accomplished his
      term and died; and as for his son Zein ul Asnam, he arose and donning the
      raiment of woe, [mourned] for his father the space of six days. On the
      seventh day he arose and going forth to the Divan, sat down on the throne
      of the sultanate and held a court, wherein was a great assemblage of the
      folk, <a href="#linknote-34" name="linknoteref-34" id="linknoteref-34"><small>34</small></a>
      and the viziers came forward and the grandees of the realm and condoled
      with him for his father and called down blessings upon him and gave him
      joy of the kingship and the sultanate, beseeching God to grant him
      continuance of glory and prosperity without end.
    </p>
    <p>
      When <a href="#linknote-35" name="linknoteref-35" id="linknoteref-35"><small>35</small></a>
      Zein ul Asnam saw himself in this great might and wealth, and he young in
      years, he inclined unto prodigality and to the converse of springalds like
      himself and fell to squandering vast sums upon his pleasures and left
      governance and concern for his subjects. The queen his mother proceeded to
      admonish him and to forbid him from his ill fashions, bidding him leave
      that manner of life and apply himself governance and administration and
      the ordinance of the realm, lest the folk reject him and rise up against
      him and expel <a href="#linknote-36" name="linknoteref-36"
      id="linknoteref-36"><small>36</small></a> hira; but he would hear not a
      word from her and abode in his ignorance and folly. At this the people
      murmured, for that the grandees of the realm put out their hands unto
      oppression, whenas they saw the king's lack of concern for his subjects;
      so they rose up in rebellion against Zein ul Asnam and would have laid
      violent hands upon him, had not the queen his mother been a woman of wit
      and judgment and address, and the people loved her; so she appeased the
      folk and promised them good. Then she called her son Zein ul Asnam to her
      and said to him, "See, O my son; said I not to thee that thou wouldest
      lose thy kingship and eke thy life, an thou persistedst in this thine
      ignorance and folly, in that thou givest the ordinance of the sultanate
      into the hands of raw youths and eschewest the old and wastest thy
      substance and that of the realm, squandering it all upon lewdness and the
      lust of thy soul?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Zein ul Asnam hearkened to his mother's rede and going out forthright to
      the Divan, committed the manage of the realm into the hands of certain old
      men of understanding and experience; save that he did this only after
      Bassora had been ruined, inasmuch as he turned not from his folly till he
      had spent and squandered all the treasures of the sultanate and was become
      exceeding poor. Then he betook himself to repentance and to sorrowing over
      that which he had done, <a href="#linknote-37" name="linknoteref-37"
      id="linknoteref-37"><small>37</small></a> so that he lost the solace of
      sleep and eschewed meat and drink, till one night of the nights,&mdash;and
      indeed he had spent it in mourning and lamentation and melancholy thought
      until the last of the night,&mdash;his eyes closed for a little and there
      appeared to him in his sleep a venerable old man, who said to him, "O Zein
      ul Asnam, grieve not, for that nought followeth after grief save relief
      from stress, and an thou desire to be delivered from this thine
      affliction, arise and betake thee to Cairo, where thou wilt find
      treasuries of wealth which shall stand thee in stead of that thou hast
      squandered, ay, and twofold the sum thereof." When he awoke from his
      sleep, he acquainted his mother with all that he had seen in his dream,
      and she fell to laughing at him; but he said to her, "Laugh not, for needs
      must I journey to Cairo." "O my son," answered she, "put not thy trust in
      dreams, for that they are all vain fancies and lying imaginations." And he
      said to her, "Nay, my dream was a true one and the man whom I saw is of
      the Friends of God <a href="#linknote-38" name="linknoteref-38"
      id="linknoteref-38"><small>38</small></a> and his speech is very sooth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, he left the sultanate and going forth a-journeying one night
      of the nights, took the road to Egypt [and fared on] days and nights till
      he came to the city of Cairo. So he entered it and saw it a great and
      magnificent city; then, being perished for weariness, he took shelter in
      one of its mosques. When he had rested awhile, he went forth and bought
      him somewhat to eat; and after he had eaten, he fell asleep in the mosque,
      of the excess of his weariness, nor had he slept but a little when the old
      man appeared to him in his sleep and said to him, "O Zein ul Assam, <a
      href="#linknote-39" name="linknoteref-39" id="linknoteref-39"><small>39</small></a>
      thou hast done as I said to thee, and indeed I made proof of thee, that I
      might see an thou wert valiant or not; but now I know thee, inasmuch as
      thou hast put faith in my rede and hast done according thereto. So now
      return to thine own city and I will make thee a king rich after such a
      measure that neither before thee nor after thee shall [any] of the kings
      be like unto thee." So Zein ul Asnam arose from his sleep and said, "In
      the name of God the Compassionate, the Merciful! What is this old man who
      hath wearier me, so that I came to Cairo, <a href="#linknote-40"
      name="linknoteref-40" id="linknoteref-40"><small>40</small></a> and I
      trusted in him and deemed of him that he was the Prophet (whom God bless
      and keep) or one of the pious Friends of God? But there is no power and no
      virtue save in God the Most High, the Supreme. By Allah. I did well in
      that I acquainted none with my sallying forth neither related my dream
      unto any! <a href="#linknote-41" name="linknoteref-41" id="linknoteref-41"><small>41</small></a>
      Indeed. I believed in this old man and meseemed by that which appeared to
      me, he was none of mankind, <a href="#linknote-42" name="linknoteref-42"
      id="linknoteref-42"><small>42</small></a> extolled be His perfection and
      magnified be He who [alone] knoweth the truth! By Allah, I will leave
      trusting in this old man [neither will I comply with him] in that which he
      would have me do!" Accordingly, he lay [the rest of] that night [in the
      mosque] and at daybreak he arose and mounting his courser, set out on his
      return to Bassora, [the seat of] his kingship, where, after a few days, he
      arrived and went in that same night to his mother, who asked him if aught
      had befallen him of that which the old man had promised him. He acquainted
      her with that which he had seen [in his sleep] and she fell to condoling
      with him and comforting him, saying, "Grieve not, O my son, for, an God
      the Most High have appointed thee aught of [good] fortune, thou wilt
      attain thereto without either travail or toil; but I would have thee be
      understanding and discreet and leave these things which have brought thee
      to poverty, O my son, and eschew singing-wenches and the commerce of
      youths and women; all this is for the baser sort, not for kings' sons like
      thee." And he swore to her that he would never more gainsay her
      commandment, but would observe all that she should say to him and would
      turn his mind to the governance and the kingship and leave that wherefrom
      she forbade him. Then he slept that night and what while he was on sleep,
      the old man appeared to him and said to him, "O Zein ul Asnam, O valiant
      one, whenas thou arisest from thy sleep this day, I will accomplish my
      promise to thee; wherefore take thou a pickaxe and go to the palace of thy
      father Such-an-one <a href="#linknote-43" name="linknoteref-43"
      id="linknoteref-43"><small>43</small></a> in such a place and dig there in
      the earth and thou wilt find that which shall enrich thee."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Zein ul Asnam awoke from his sleep, he hastened to his mother,
      rejoicing, and acquainted her with his dream; whereupon she fell again to
      laughing at him and said to him, "O my son, indeed this old man laugheth
      at thee, nought else; wherefore do thou turn thy thought from him." But he
      said to her, "Nay, mother mine, indeed he is soothfast and lieth not; for
      that, in the first of his dealing, he tried me and now his intent is to
      accomplish unto me his promise." "In any case," rejoined she, "the thing
      is not toilsome; <a href="#linknote-44" name="linknoteref-44"
      id="linknoteref-44"><small>44</small></a> so do that which thou wilt, even
      as he said to thee, and make proof of the matter, and God willing, thou
      shalt <a href="#linknote-45" name="linknoteref-45" id="linknoteref-45"><small>45</small></a>
      return to me rejoicing; but methinketh thou wilt return to me and say,
      'Thou saidst sooth, O my mother, in thy rede."' The prince accordingly
      took a pickaxe and going down to the palace where his father was buried,
      fell a-delving in the earth; nor had he dug long when, behold, there
      appeared to him a ring fixed in a slab of marble. He raised the slab and
      seeing a stair, descended thereby and found a great vault, all builded
      with columns of marble and alabaster; then, proceeding innerward, he found
      within the vault a hall which ravished the wit, and therein eight jars of
      green jasper; <a href="#linknote-46" name="linknoteref-46"
      id="linknoteref-46"><small>46</small></a> and he said, "What be these jars
      and what is in them?" So <a href="#linknote-47" name="linknoteref-47"
      id="linknoteref-47"><small>47</small></a> he went up and uncovering them,
      found them all full of old gold; <a href="#linknote-48"
      name="linknoteref-48" id="linknoteref-48"><small>48</small></a> whereupon
      he took a little in his hand and going to his mother, gave her thereof and
      said to her, "Thou seest, O my mother." She marvelled at this thing and
      said to him, "Beware, O my son, lest thou squander it, like as thou
      squanderedst other than this." And he swore to her, saying, "Be not
      concerned, O my mother, and let not thy heart be other than easy on my
      account, for I would fain have thee also content with me." <a
      href="#linknote-49" name="linknoteref-49" id="linknoteref-49"><small>49</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she arose and went with him, and they descended into the vault and
      entered the [underground] hall, <a href="#linknote-50"
      name="linknoteref-50" id="linknoteref-50"><small>50</small></a> where she
      beheld that which ravished the wit and saw the jars of gold. What while
      they diverted themselves with gazing upon these latter, behold, they
      espied a little jar of fine jade; so Zein ul Asnam opened it and found in
      it a golden key. Whereupon quoth his mother to him, "O my son, needs must
      there be a door here which this key will open." Accordingly they sought in
      all parts of the vault and the hall, so they might see an there were a
      door or what not else to be found there, and presently espied a bolted
      lock, to which they knew that this must be the key. So Zein ul Asnam went
      up and putting the key in the lock, turned it and opened a door which
      admitted them into a second hall, <a href="#linknote-51"
      name="linknoteref-51" id="linknoteref-51"><small>51</small></a> more
      magnificent than the first; and it was all full of a light which dazzled
      the sight, yet was there no flambeau kindled therein, no, nor any window
      <a href="#linknote-52" name="linknoteref-52" id="linknoteref-52"><small>52</small></a>
      there, whereat they marvelled and looking farther, saw eight images of
      jewels, each one piece, and that of noble jewels, pure and precious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zein ul Asnam was amazed at this and said to his mother, "How came my
      father by these things?" And they fell to looking and considering, till
      presently the queen espied a curtain of silk, whereon were these words
      written: "O my son, marvel not at these great riches, whereto I have won
      by dint of sore travail; but know that there existeth also another image
      whose worth is more than that of these [eight] images twenty times told.
      Wherefore, an thou wouldst come thereby, get thee to Cairo, where thou
      wilt find a slave of mine, by name Mubarek, who will take thee and bring
      thee in company <a href="#linknote-53" name="linknoteref-53"
      id="linknoteref-53"><small>53</small></a> with the ninth image. When thou
      enterest Cairo, the first man whom thou encounterest will direct thee to
      Mubarek's house, for he is known in all Egypt." <a href="#linknote-54"
      name="linknoteref-54" id="linknoteref-54"><small>54</small></a> When Zein
      ul Asnam read this inscription, he said, "O my mother, it is my wish to
      journey to Cairo, so I may make search for the ninth image. Tell me, how
      deemest thou of my dream? Was it true or was it not? Wilt thou still say
      <a href="#linknote-55" name="linknoteref-55" id="linknoteref-55"><small>55</small></a>
      to me, 'These be idle tales'? But I, O my mother, needs must I journey to
      Cairo." "O my son," answered the queen, "since thou art under the
      safeguard of the Apostle of God <a href="#linknote-56"
      name="linknoteref-56" id="linknoteref-56"><small>56</small></a> (whom God
      bless and keep), go thou in peace, and I [and] thy Vizier, we will govern
      the realm in thine absence, against thou shalt return."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Zein ul Asnam went forth and equipping himself [for travel, set out]
      and journeyed till he came to Cairo, where he enquired for Mubarek's house
      and the folk said to him, "O my lord, this is a man than whom there is
      none richer in [all Cairo]; no, nor is there a more abounding than he in
      bounty and beneficence, and his house is [still] open to the stranger." So
      they directed him thither and he went till he came to the house and
      knocked at the door; whereupon there came out to him one of Mubarek's
      slaves and <a href="#linknote-57" name="linknoteref-57" id="linknoteref-57"><small>57</small></a>
      opening the door, said to him, "Who art thou and what wiliest thou?" Quoth
      Zein ul Asnam, "I am a stranger, a man from a far country, and I heard
      tell of your lord, Mubarek, and how he is renowned for hospitality and
      beneficence; so I came to him, that I may be a guest with him." The slave
      entered and told his lord Mubarek; then returned and said to Zein ul
      Asnam, "O my lord, blessing hath descended upon us in thy coming. <a
      href="#linknote-58" name="linknoteref-58" id="linknoteref-58"><small>58</small></a>
      Enter, for my lord Mubarek awaiteth thee." So Zein ul Asnam entered into a
      courtyard, exceeding spacious and all [full] of trees and waters, and the
      slave brought him into the pavilion <a href="#linknote-59"
      name="linknoteref-59" id="linknoteref-59"><small>59</small></a> where
      Mubarek sat. When he entered, the latter arose forthright and coming to
      meet him, received him with cordiality and said to him, "Blessing hath
      descended upon us and this night is the most auspicious of nights in thy
      coming to us! But who art thou, O youth, and whence comest thou and
      whither art thou bound?" The prince answered him, saying, "I am Zein ul
      Asnam and I seek Mubarek, slave to the Sultan of Bassora, who died a year
      agone and whose son I am." "What sayst thou?" cried Mubarek. "Art thou the
      king's son of Bassora?" "Yea, verily," replied Zein ul Asnam; "I am his
      son." Quoth Mubarek, "Nay, my lord the king of Bassora left no son; but
      what is thine age, O youth?" "About twenty years," replied Zein ul Asnam.
      "And thou," added he, "how long is it since thou wentest out from my
      father's house?" "I went out eighteen years agone," answered Mubarek.
      "But, O my son Zein ul Asnam, by what token canst thou certify me that
      thou art the son of my lord the king of Bassora?" Quoth Zein ul Asnam,
      "Thou knowest that my father builded under his palace a vault and therein
      [a hall in which] he set forty <a href="#linknote-60" name="linknoteref-60"
      id="linknoteref-60"><small>60</small></a> jars of fine jade and filled
      them with ancient gold; <a href="#linknote-61" name="linknoteref-61"
      id="linknoteref-61"><small>61</small></a> and within this hall he made a
      second hall, wherein he placed eight images of precious stones, each
      wroughten of a single jewel and seated upon a throne of virgin gold. <a
      href="#linknote-62" name="linknoteref-62" id="linknoteref-62"><small>62</small></a>
      Moreover, he wrote upon a curtain of silk there and I read the writ,
      whereby I found that he bade me come to thee, saying that thou wouldst
      acquaint me of the ninth image and where it is, the which, said he, was
      worth the eight, all of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mubarek heard these words, he threw himself at Zein ul Asnam's feet
      and fell to kissing them and saying, "Pardon me, O my lord! Verily, thou
      art the son of my lord." Then said he to the prince, "O my lord, I make
      to-day a banquet unto all the chief men of Cairo and I would fain have thy
      highness honour me [with thy presence] thereat." And Zein ul Asnam said,
      "With all my heart." <a href="#linknote-63" name="linknoteref-63"
      id="linknoteref-63"><small>63</small></a> So Mubarek arose and foregoing
      Zein ul Asnam, brought him into the saloon, which was full of the chief
      men of Cairo, assembled therein. There he sat down and seating the prince
      in the place of honour, called for the evening-meal. So they laid the
      tables and Mubarek stood to serve Zein ul Asnam, with his hands clasped
      behind him <a href="#linknote-64" name="linknoteref-64" id="linknoteref-64"><small>64</small></a>
      and whiles seated upon his knees [and heels]. <a href="#linknote-65"
      name="linknoteref-65" id="linknoteref-65"><small>65</small></a> The
      notables of Cairo marvelled at this, how Mubarek, the chiefest of them,
      should serve the youth, and <a href="#linknote-66" name="linknoteref-66"
      id="linknoteref-66"><small>66</small></a> were sore amazed thereat,
      knowing not [who or] whence he was. But, after they had eaten and drunken
      and supped and were of good cheer, Mubarek turned to the company and said
      to them, "O folk, marvel not that I serve this youth with all worship and
      assiduity, for that he is the son of my lord the Sultan of Bassora, whose
      slave I was, for that he bought me with his money and died without setting
      me free; wherefore it behoveth me serve my lord, and all that my hand
      possesseth of monies and gear is his, nor is anywhit thereof mine." When
      the notables of Cairo heard this speech, they arose to Zein ul Asnam and
      did him exceeding great worship and saluted him with all reverence and
      prayed for him; <a href="#linknote-67" name="linknoteref-67"
      id="linknoteref-67"><small>67</small></a> and he said, "O company, I am
      before your presence and ye are witnesses [of that which I am about to
      do." Then, turning to his host,] "O Mubarek, [quoth he,] thou art free and
      all that is with thee of monies and gear appertaining unto us shall
      henceforth be thine and thou art altogether acquitted thereof <a
      href="#linknote-68" name="linknoteref-68" id="linknoteref-68"><small>68</small></a>
      and of every part thereof. Moreover, do thou ask of me whatsoever thou
      desirest by way of boon, <a href="#linknote-69" name="linknoteref-69"
      id="linknoteref-69"><small>69</small></a> for that I will nowise gainsay
      thee in aught thou mayst seek." <a href="#linknote-70"
      name="linknoteref-70" id="linknoteref-70"><small>70</small></a> Thereupon
      Mubarek arose and kissed the prince's hand and thanked him, saying, "O my
      lord, I will nought of thee save that thou be well; for indeed the wealth
      that I have is exceeding abundant upon me."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Zein ul Asnam abode with Mubarek four days and every day the chief men
      of Cairo came to salute him, whenas it reached them that this was
      Mubarek's lord, the Sultan of Bassora; then, after he was rested, he said
      to his host, "O Mubarek, indeed the time is long upon me;" <a
      href="#linknote-71" name="linknoteref-71" id="linknoteref-71"><small>71</small></a>
      and Mubarek said to him, "Thou must know, O my lord, that this whereof
      thou art come in quest is a hard <a href="#linknote-72"
      name="linknoteref-72" id="linknoteref-72"><small>72</small></a> matter,
      nay, even unto danger of death, and I know not if thy fortitude may
      suffice thee for the achievement thereof." <a href="#linknote-73"
      name="linknoteref-73" id="linknoteref-73"><small>73</small></a> "Know, O
      Mubarek," rejoined Zein ul Asnam, "that wealth [is gotten] by blood <a
      href="#linknote-74" name="linknoteref-74" id="linknoteref-74"><small>74</small></a>
      and there betideth a man nought except by the will and foreordinance of
      the Creator (to whom belong might and majesty ); so do thou take heart and
      concern not thyself on my account." Accordingly Mubarek forthright
      commended his slaves equip them for travel; so they made all ready and
      taking horse, journeyed days and nights in the foulest of deserts, <a
      href="#linknote-75" name="linknoteref-75" id="linknoteref-75"><small>75</small></a>
      witnessing daily things and matters which confounded their wits,&mdash;things
      such as never in their time had they seen,&mdash;until they drew near the
      place [of their destination]; whereupon they lighted down from their
      steeds and Mubarek bade the slaves and servants abide there, saying to
      them, "Keep watch over the beasts of burden and the horses till we return
      to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the twain set out together afoot and Mubarek said to Zein ul Asnam,
      "O my lord, now behoveth fortitude, for that thou art in the land of the
      image whereof thou comest in quest." And they gave not over walking till
      they drew near a great lake and a wide, whereupon quoth Mubarek to Zein ul
      Asnam, "Know, O my lord, that there will presently come to us a little
      boat, bearing a blue flag and builded all with planks of sandal and
      Comorin aloes-wood of price; and [thereanent] I have a charge to give
      thee, which it behoveth thee observe." "What is this charge?" asked the
      prince and Mubarek said to him, "In this boat thou wilt see a boatman, <a
      href="#linknote-76" name="linknoteref-76" id="linknoteref-76"><small>76</small></a>
      but his make is monstrous; <a href="#linknote-77" name="linknoteref-77"
      id="linknoteref-77"><small>77</small></a> wherefore be thou ware and
      again, I say, beware lest thou speak aught, for that he will incontinent
      drown us; and know that this place appertaineth to the King of the Jinn
      and that all thou seest is their handiwork." Then <a href="#linknote-78"
      name="linknoteref-78" id="linknoteref-78"><small>78</small></a> they came
      to the lake and behold, a little boat with planks of sandal and Comorin
      aloes-wood and in it a boatman, whose head was [as] the head of an
      elephant and the rest of his body [as that of] a wild beast. <a
      href="#linknote-79" name="linknoteref-79" id="linknoteref-79"><small>79</small></a>
      When he drew near them, he wrapped his trunk about them both and taking
      them with him into the boat, rowed out with them to the midst of the lake,
      then fared on with them <a href="#linknote-80" name="linknoteref-80"
      id="linknoteref-80"><small>80</small></a> till he brought them to the
      other shore, where they landed and walking on, saw there trees of
      ambergris <a href="#linknote-81" name="linknoteref-81" id="linknoteref-81"><small>81</small></a>
      and aloes and sandal-wood and cloves and jessamine, <a href="#linknote-82"
      name="linknoteref-82" id="linknoteref-82"><small>82</small></a> full-grown
      and laden with ripe fruits and flowers <a href="#linknote-83"
      name="linknoteref-83" id="linknoteref-83"><small>83</small></a> whose
      fragrance dilated the breast and cheered the spright; and there [they
      heard] the voices of the birds twittering their various notes and
      ravishing the wit with their warblings. So Mubarek turned to Zein ul Asnam
      and said to him, "How deemest thou of this place, O my lord?" And the
      prince answered him, saying, "Methinketh, O Mubarek, this is the paradise
      which the Prophet (whom God bless and keep) promised us withal."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they fared on till they came to a magnificent palace, builded all
      with stones of emerald and rubies, and its doors were of sheer gold.
      Before it was a bridge, the length whereof was an hundred and fifty cubits
      and its breadth fifty cubits, and it was [wroughten] of the rib of a fish;
      whilst at the other end of the bridge were many warriors <a
      href="#linknote-84" name="linknoteref-84" id="linknoteref-84"><small>84</small></a>
      of the Jinn, gruesome and terrible of aspect, and all of them bore in
      their hands javelins of steel that flashed in the sun like winter
      lightning. <a href="#linknote-85" name="linknoteref-85" id="linknoteref-85"><small>85</small></a>
      Quoth Zein ul Asnam to Mubarek, "This is a thing that taketh the wits;"
      and Mubarek said to him, "It behoveth us abide in our place neither fare
      forward, lest a mischance betide us. O God, [vouchsafe us] safety!"
      Therewith he brought out of his pocket four pieces of yellow silken stuff
      and girded himself with one thereof; the second he laid on his shoulders
      and gave Zein ul Asnam other two pieces, with which he girded himself [and
      covered his shoulders] on like wise. Moreover, he spread before each of
      them a sash of white silk and bringing forth of his pocket precious stones
      and perfumes, such as ambergris and aloes-wood, (set them on the edges
      thereof) <a href="#linknote-86" name="linknoteref-86" id="linknoteref-86"><small>86</small></a>
      after which they sat down, each on his sash, and Mubarek taught Zein ul
      Asnam these words, which he should say to the King of the Jinn, to wit: "O
      my lord King of the Jinn, we are in thy safeguard." And Zein ul Asnam said
      to him, "And I will instantly conjure him that he accept of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then said Mubarek, "O my lord, by Allah, I am exceeding fearful. But now
      hearken; an he be minded to accept of us without hurt, he will come to us
      in the semblance of a man accomplished in grace and goodliness; but, an he
      have no mind to us, he will come to us in a gruesome and a frightful
      aspect. An thou see him surpassing in beauty, arise forthright and salute
      him, but beware lest thou overpass thy sash." And Zein ul Asnam said to
      him, "Hearkening and obedience." "And be this thy salutation to him,"
      continued Mubarek; "thou shalt say, 'O King of the Jinn and lord of the
      earth, my father, the Sultan of Bassora, the angel of death hath removed,
      as indeed is not hidden from thee. Now Thy Grace was still wont to take my
      father under thy protection, and I come to thee likewise to put myself
      under thy safeguard, even as did he.' Moreover, <a href="#linknote-87"
      name="linknoteref-87" id="linknoteref-87"><small>87</small></a> O my lord
      Zein ul Asnam," added he, "an the King of the Jinn receive us with a
      cheerful favour, he will without fail ask thee and say to thee, 'Seek of
      me that which thou wiliest and thou shalt forthright be given [it].' <a
      href="#linknote-88" name="linknoteref-88" id="linknoteref-88"><small>88</small></a>
      So do thou seek of him and say to him, 'O my lord, I crave of Thy Grace
      the ninth image, than which there is not the world a more precious; and
      indeed Thy Grace promised my father that thou wouldst give it to me."'
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus taught his lord how he should speak with the King of the Jinn
      and seek of him the ninth image and how he should make his speech seemly
      and pleasant, Mubarek fell to conjuring and fumigating and reciting words
      that might not be understanded; and no great while passed ere the world
      lightened <a href="#linknote-89" name="linknoteref-89" id="linknoteref-89"><small>89</small></a>
      and rain fell in torrents <a href="#linknote-90" name="linknoteref-90"
      id="linknoteref-90"><small>90</small></a> and it thundered and darkness
      covered the face of the earth; and after this there came a tempestuous
      wind and a voice like an earthquake of the earthquakes <a
      href="#linknote-91" name="linknoteref-91" id="linknoteref-91"><small>91</small></a>
      of the Day of Resurrection. When Zein ul Asnam saw these portents, his
      joints trembled and he was sore affrighted, for that he beheld a thing he
      had never in all his life seen nor heard. But Mubarek laughed at him and
      said to him, "Fear not, O my lord; this whereat thou art affrighted is
      that which we seek; nay, it is a presage of good to-us. So take heart and
      be of good cheer." After this there came a great clearness and serenity
      and there breathed pure and fragrant breezes; then, presently, behold,
      there appeared the King of the Jinn in the semblance of a man comely of
      favour, there was none like unto him in his goodliness, save He who hath
      no like and to whom belong might and majesty. He looked on Zein ul Asnam
      and Mubarek with a cheerful, smiling countenance; whereupon the prince
      arose forthright and proffered him his petition in the words which Mubarek
      had taught him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King of the Jinn turned to him, smiling, and said to him, "O Zein ul
      Asnam, indeed I loved thy father the Sultan of Bassora, and I used,
      whenassoever he came to me, to give him an image of those which thou hast
      seen, each wroughten of a single jewel, and thou also shalt stand in thy
      father's stead with me and shalt find favour in mine eyes, even as did he,
      ay, and more. Before he died, I caused him write the writ which thou
      sawest on the curtain of silk and promised him that I would take thee
      under my protection, even as himself, and would give thee the ninth image,
      which is more of worth than those which thou hast seen. Now it is my
      intent to perform the promise which I made to thy father, that I would
      take thee under my protection, and <a href="#linknote-92"
      name="linknoteref-92" id="linknoteref-92"><small>92</small></a> [know
      that] I was the old man whom thou sawest in thy sleep and it was I bade
      thee dig in the palace for the vault wherein thou foundest the jars of
      gold and the images of jewels. I know also wherefore thou art come hither;
      nay, I am he that was the cause of thy coming, and I will give thee that
      which thou seekest, albeit I had not given it to thy father; but on
      condition that thou swear to me a solemn oath and abide me constant
      thereto, to wit, that thou wilt return and bring me a girl of the age of
      fifteen years, with whom there shall be none to match in loveliness, and
      she must be a clean maid, who shall never have lusted after man, nor shall
      man have lusted after her. Moreover, thou must swear to me that thou wilt
      keep faith with her, coming, and beware lest thou play me false with her
      by the way."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Zein ul Asnam swore a solemn oath to him of this and said to him, "O my
      lord, indeed, thou honourest me with this service; but methinketh it will
      be hard to find a girl like this. Nay, supposing I find a damsel fifteen
      years of age and beautiful exceedingly, according to Thy Grace's
      requirement, how shall I know that she hath never in her time lusted after
      man nor hath man lusted after her?" "O Zein ul Asnam," replied the King of
      the Jinn, "thou art in the right and certain it is that this knowledge is
      a thing unto which the sons of man may not avail; but I will give thee a
      mirror of my fashion, and when thou seest a girl and her beauty pleaseth
      thee and her grace, do thou open this mirror that I shall give thee, and
      if thou find her image therein clear and bright, thou shalt know
      forthright that she is pure without default and that all good qualities
      are in her; so do thou take her for me. If thou find her image in the
      mirror other than this, to wit, an it be troubled and clothed with
      uncleanness, know that the girl is sullied and beware of her; but, an thou
      find one such as she whose qualities I have set out to thee, bring her to
      me and watch over her [by the way;] yet beware and again I say, beware of
      treason and bethink thee that, an thou keep not faith with me, thou wilt
      assuredly lose thy life."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Zein ul Asnam made with him a stable and abiding covenant, the covenant
      of the sons of kings, that he would keep the plighted faith and never play
      him false, but <a href="#linknote-93" name="linknoteref-93"
      id="linknoteref-93"><small>93</small></a> would bring him the damsel with
      all continence. Then the King of the Jinn delivered him the mirror and
      said to him, "O my son, take this mirror whereof I bespoke thee, and now
      depart." Accordingly Zein ul Asnam and Mubarek arose and calling down
      blessings upon the King, returned upon their steps till they came to the
      lake, where they sat a little and behold, up came the boat which had
      brought them and the genie rowing therein, whose head was as <a
      href="#linknote-94" name="linknoteref-94" id="linknoteref-94"><small>94</small></a>
      the head of an elephant. Now this was by the commandment of the King of
      the Jinn; so they embarked with the genie and crossed with him to the
      other shore; after which they returned to Cairo and entering Mubarek's
      house, abode there awhile till they were rested from the fatigue of the
      journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Zein ul Asnam turned to Mubarek and said to him, "Come, let us go to
      the city of Baghdad, so we may seek for a girl who shall be according to
      the requirement of the King of the Jinn." And Mubarek said to him, "O my
      lord, we are in Cairo, the city of cities and the wonder of the world. <a
      href="#linknote-95" name="linknoteref-95" id="linknoteref-95"><small>95</small></a>
      I shall without fail find a girl here and it needeth not that we go to a
      far city." "Thou sayst sooth, O Mubarek," rejoined the prince; "but how
      shall we set about the matter and how shall we do to come by <a
      href="#linknote-96" name="linknoteref-96" id="linknoteref-96"><small>96</small></a>
      a girl like this and who shall go seeking her for us?" "O my lord,"
      replied Mubarek, "concern not thyself <a href="#linknote-97"
      name="linknoteref-97" id="linknoteref-97"><small>97</small></a> for that,
      for I have with me here an old woman (upon her, [to speak] figuratively,
      <a href="#linknote-98" name="linknoteref-98" id="linknoteref-98"><small>98</small></a>
      be the malediction [of God] <a href="#linknote-99" name="linknoteref-99"
      id="linknoteref-99"><small>99</small></a>) who is a mistress of wiles and
      craft and guile and not to be baulked by any hindrance, however great."
      Then he sent to fetch the old woman and telling her that he wanted a
      damsel fifteen years old and fair exceedingly, so he might marry her to
      the son of his lord, promised her largesse galore, an she did her utmost
      endeavour in the matter; whereupon, "O my lord," answered she, "be easy; I
      will accomplish unto thee thy desire beyond thy wish; for that under my
      hand are damsels unpeered in grace and goodliness and all of them
      daughters of men of condition." But, O King of the time, <a
      href="#linknote-100" name="linknoteref-100" id="linknoteref-100"><small>100</small></a>
      the old woman had no knowledge of the affair of the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she arose and went out to go round about in the city and to run along
      its ways, <a href="#linknote-101" name="linknoteref-101"
      id="linknoteref-101"><small>101</small></a> seeking <a href="#linknote-102"
      name="linknoteref-102" id="linknoteref-102"><small>102</small></a> the
      girl for Prince Zein ul Asnam, and whenassoever she saw a fair damsel,
      accomplished in beauty, she proceeded to bring her to Mubarek; but, when
      he looked at her in the mirror, he would see her image troubled
      exceedingly and would leave her; so that the old woman brought him all the
      damsels of Cairo, but there was not found among them one whose image in
      the mirror was clear; wherefore he bethought him to go to Baghdad, since
      he found not one in Cairo who pleased him [or] who was a clean maid, like
      as the King of the Jinn had enjoined him. So he arose and equipping
      himself, [set out and] journeyed, he and Zein ul Asnam, till they came to
      the city of Baghdad, where they hired them a magnificent palace
      amiddleward the city and took up their abode therein. There the chief men
      of the city used to come to them every day and sat at their table, even to
      the comer and goer by night and by day. <a href="#linknote-103"
      name="linknoteref-103" id="linknoteref-103"><small>103</small></a>
      Moreover, when there remained aught from their table, they distributed it
      to the poor and the afflicted and all the strangers in the mosques <a
      href="#linknote-104" name="linknoteref-104" id="linknoteref-104"><small>104</small></a>
      would come and eat with them. So the report was noised abroad in the land
      of their generosity and bounty and they became in high repute and fair
      fame throughout all Baghdad, nor did any talk but of Zein ul Asnam and his
      bounty and wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it chanced that in one of the mosques was an Imam, <a
      href="#linknote-105" name="linknoteref-105" id="linknoteref-105"><small>105</small></a>
      corrupt, envious and despiteful in the extreme, and his lodging was near
      the palace wherein Mubatek and Zein ul Asnam had taken up their abode.
      When he heard of their bounty and generosity and of the goodliness of
      their repute, envy get hold upon him and jealousy of them, and he fell to
      bethinking himself how he should do, so he might bring some calamity upon
      them and despoil them of that their fair fortune, for it is of the wont of
      envy that it falleth not but upon the rich. So, one day of the days, as he
      stood in the mosque, after the mid-afternoon prayer, he came forward into
      the midst of the folk and said, "O my brethren, O ye of the True Faith, ye
      who ascribe unity to God, know that in this our quarter there be two men
      dwelling, strangers, and most like you are acquainted with them. Now these
      twain spend and squander wealth galore, passing all measure, and in my
      belief they are none other than thieves and highwaymen and are come hither
      with that which they stole from their own country, so they may squander
      it." Then <a href="#linknote-106" name="linknoteref-106"
      id="linknoteref-106"><small>106</small></a> "O people of Mohammed," added
      he, "I rede you for God's sake keep yourselves from these tricksters, <a
      href="#linknote-107" name="linknoteref-107" id="linknoteref-107"><small>107</small></a>
      lest belike the Khalif come presently to know of these two men and ye also
      fall with them into calamity. Now I have warned you and I wash my hands of
      your affair, for that I have forewarned and awakened you; so do that which
      you deem well." And they said to him, all who were present, with one
      voice, "We will do whatsoever thou wiliest, O Aboubekr!" When the Imam
      heard this from them, he arose and taking inkhorn and pen and paper, fell
      to writing a letter to the Commander of the Faithful, setting forth to him
      [the case] against Zein ul Asnam and Mubarek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as destiny willed it, the latter chanced to be in the mosque among
      the folk and heard the accursed Imam's discourse and that which he did by
      way of writing the letter to the Khalif; whereupon he tarried not, but,
      returning home forthwith, took an hundred diners and made him a parcel of
      price, all of silken clothes, <a href="#linknote-108"
      name="linknoteref-108" id="linknoteref-108"><small>108</small></a>
      wherewith he betook himself in haste to Aboubekr's house and knocked at
      the door. The Imam came out to him and opened the door; and when he saw
      him, he asked him surlily who he was and what he would; whereupon quoth
      the other, "O my lord the Imam Aboubekr, I am thy slave Mubarek and I come
      to thee on the part of my lord the Amir Zein ul Asnam. He hath heard of
      thy learning and of the excellence of thy repute in the city and would
      fain become acquainted with thee and do that which behoveth unto thee;
      wherefore he hath presently sent me with these things and this money for
      thine expenses and hopeth of thee that thou wilt not blame him, inasmuch
      as this is little for thy worth, but hereafter, God willing, he will not
      fail of that which is due unto thee." Aboubekr looked at [the coins and]
      at their impress and yellowness <a href="#linknote-109"
      name="linknoteref-109" id="linknoteref-109"><small>109</small></a> and at
      the parcel of clothes and said to Mubarek, "O my lord, [I crave] pardon of
      thy lord the Amir, for that I am presently abashed before him <a
      href="#linknote-110" name="linknoteref-110" id="linknoteref-110"><small>110</small></a>
      and it irketh me sore that I have not done my duty towards him; <a
      href="#linknote-111" name="linknoteref-111" id="linknoteref-111"><small>111</small></a>
      but I hope of thee that thou wilt intercede with him on my behalf, so he
      may of his favour pardon me my default; and (the Creator willing) I will
      to-morrow do that which behoveth me and will go do my service to him <a
      href="#linknote-112" name="linknoteref-112" id="linknoteref-112"><small>112</small></a>
      and proffer him the respect which is due from me to him." "O my lord
      Aboubekr," replied Mubarek, "the extreme of my lord's desire is to look
      upon thy worship, so he may be honoured by thy presence and get of thee a
      blessing." So saying, he kissed the Imam's hand and returned to his
      lodging.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow, whilst Aboubekr was [engaged] in the Friday prayers at
      dawn, he stood up amongst the folk, in the midst of the mosque, and said,
      "O our brethren of the Muslims and people of Mohammed, all of you, verily
      envy falleth not save upon the rich and the noble and passeth by the poor
      and those of low estate. Know that of the two stranger men against whom I
      spoke yesterday one is an Amir, a man of great rank and noble birth, and
      the case is not as certain of the envious <a href="#linknote-113"
      name="linknoteref-113" id="linknoteref-113"><small>113</small></a>
      informed me concerning him, to wit, that he was a thief and a robber; for
      I have enquired into the matter and find that the report lieth. So beware
      lest any of you missay of the Amir or speak aught of evil against him,
      such as that which I heard yesterday, or you will cause me and yourselves
      fall into the gravest of calamities with the Commander of the Faithful;
      for that a man of high degree like this cannot sojourn in the city of
      Baghdad without the Khalif's knowledge." On <a href="#linknote-114"
      name="linknoteref-114" id="linknoteref-114"><small>114</small></a> this
      wise, then, the Imam Aboubekr did away from the minds of the folk the ill
      thought <a href="#linknote-115" name="linknoteref-115" id="linknoteref-115"><small>115</small></a>
      which he had planted [there] by his speech concerning Zein ul Asnam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, when he had made an end of the prayers, he returned to his own
      house and donned his gabardine; then, weightening his skirts and
      lengthening his sleeves, <a href="#linknote-116" name="linknoteref-116"
      id="linknoteref-116"><small>116</small></a> he went forth and took his way
      to the prince's house. When he came in to Zein ul Asnam, the latter rose
      to him and received him with the utmost reverence. Now he was by nature
      religious, <a href="#linknote-117" name="linknoteref-117"
      id="linknoteref-117"><small>117</small></a> for all he was a youth of
      tender age; so he proffered the Imam all manner of honour and seating him
      by his side on a high divan, let bring him coffee with ambergris. Then the
      servants spread the table for breakfast and they took their sufficiency of
      meat and drink, and when they had finished, they fell to talking and
      making merry together. Presently the Imam asked the prince and said to
      him, "O my lord Zein ul Asnam, doth your highness purpose to sojourn long
      here in Baghdad?" "Yea, verily, O our Lord the Imam," answered Zein ul
      Asnam; "my intent is to sojourn here awhile, till such time as my
      requirement be accomplished." "And what," asked Aboubekr, "is the
      requirement of my lord the Amir? Belike, an I know it, I may avail to
      further him to his wish, though I sacrifice my life for him." <a
      href="#linknote-118" name="linknoteref-118" id="linknoteref-118"><small>118</small></a>
      And the prince said to him, "I seek a damsel fifteen years of age and fair
      exceedingly, that I may marry her; but she must be pure and chaste and a
      clean maid, whom no man hath anywise defiled nor in all her life hath she
      thought upon a man; <a href="#linknote-119" name="linknoteref-119"
      id="linknoteref-119"><small>119</small></a> and she must be unique in
      grace and goodliness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O my lord," rejoined the Imam, "this is a thing exceeding hard to find;
      but I know a damsel unique in her loveliness and her age is fifteen years.
      Her father was a Vizier, who resigned office of his own motion, and he
      abideth presently at home in his palace and is exceeding jealous over his
      daughter and her bringing up. <a href="#linknote-120"
      name="linknoteref-120" id="linknoteref-120"><small>120</small></a>
      Methinketh this damsel will suit your Highness's mind, and she will
      rejoice in an Amir like your Highness, as also will her parents." Quoth
      Zein ul Asnam, "God willing, this damsel whereof thou speakest will answer
      my requirement and the accomplishment of our desire shall be at thy hands;
      <a href="#linknote-121" name="linknoteref-121" id="linknoteref-121"><small>121</small></a>
      but, O our lord the Imam, before all things my wish is to see her, so I
      may know an she be chaste or not. As for her beauty, I am assured of <a
      href="#linknote-122" name="linknoteref-122" id="linknoteref-122"><small>122</small></a>
      your worship's sufficiency and am content to trust to your word concerning
      her loveliness, to wit, that she is surpassing; but, for her chastity, you
      cannot avail to testify with certitude of her case." "And how," asked the
      Imam, "can it be possible unto you, O my lord the Amir, to know from her
      face that she is pure? An this be so, your highness is skilled in
      physiognomy. However, an your highness will vouchsafe to accompany me, I
      will carry you to her father's palace and make you known to the latter,
      and he shall bring her before you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, <a href="#linknote-123" name="linknoteref-123"
      id="linknoteref-123"><small>123</small></a> the Imam Aboubekr took Zein ul
      Asnam and carried him to the Vizier's house; and when they went in to him,
      the Vizier rose and welcomed the prince, especially when he knew that he
      was an Amir and understood from the Imam that he wished to marry his
      daughter. So he let bring the damsel before him, and when she came, he
      bade her raise the veil from her face. Accordingly she unveiled herself
      and Zein ul Asnam, looking upon her, was amazed at her grace and
      goodliness, for that never had he seen one to match with her in beauty;
      and he said in himself, "I wonder if I shall <a href="#linknote-124"
      name="linknoteref-124" id="linknoteref-124"><small>124</small></a> happen
      upon one like this damsel, since it is forbidden that she should be mine!"
      Then he brought out the mirror from his pocket and looked thereon; when,
      behold, its crystal was clear exceedingly, as it were virgin silver; and
      he observed her image in the mirror and saw it like a white dove. So he
      forthright concluded the match and sent for the Cadi and the witnesses,
      who wrote the writ <a href="#linknote-125" name="linknoteref-125"
      id="linknoteref-125"><small>125</small></a> and enthroned the bride; <a
      href="#linknote-126" name="linknoteref-126" id="linknoteref-126"><small>126</small></a>
      after which Zein ul Asnam took the Vizier, the bride's father, home with
      him to his house and sent the young lady jewels of great price. Then they
      celebrated the wedding and held high festival, never was the like thereof,
      whilst Zein ul Asnam proceeded to entertain the folk and made them
      banquets for the space of eight days. Moreover, he honoured Aboubekr the
      Imam and gave him gifts galore and brought the Vizier, the bride's father,
      presents and great rarities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, the wedding festivities being ended, Mubarek said to Zein ul Asnam,
      "Come, O my lord, let us set out on our way, lest we waste the time in
      sloth, now we have found that whereof we were in search." And the prince
      answered him, saying, "Thou art in the right." So Mubarek arose and fell
      to equipping them for the journey; moreover, he let make the young lady a
      camel-litter <a href="#linknote-127" name="linknoteref-127"
      id="linknoteref-127"><small>127</small></a> with a travelling couch, <a
      href="#linknote-128" name="linknoteref-128" id="linknoteref-128"><small>128</small></a>
      and they set out. But Mubarek knew that Zein ul Asnam was sunken deep in
      love of the damsel; so he took him and said to him, "O my lord Zein ul
      Asnam, I would fain remind thee to watch over thyself; nay, again I say,
      have a care and keep the faith which thou plightedst to the King of the
      Jinn." "O Mubarek," answered the prince, "an thou knewest the transport
      which possesseth me for the love of this young lady <a href="#linknote-129"
      name="linknoteref-129" id="linknoteref-129"><small>129</small></a> and how
      I still think of nothing but of taking her to Bassora and going in [to
      her]!" And Mubarek said to him, "Nay, O my lord; keep thy troth and play
      not the traitor to thine oath, lest there befall thee a sore calamity and
      thou lose thy life and the young lady lose hers also. Bethink thee of the
      oath which thou sworest and let not lust get the mastery over thine
      understanding, lest thou lose guerdan <a href="#linknote-130"
      name="linknoteref-130" id="linknoteref-130"><small>130</small></a> and
      honour and life." "O Mubarek," rejoined Zein ul Asnam, "keep thou watch
      over her thyself and let me not see her." So <a href="#linknote-131"
      name="linknoteref-131" id="linknoteref-131"><small>131</small></a> Mubarek
      fell to keeping watch and ward over the bride in the prince's stead and
      guarded the latter also, lest he should look on her; and so they journeyed
      on past the road leading unto Egypt and fared on their way to the Island
      of the Jinn.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the bride beheld the journey (and indeed it was long upon her) and
      saw not her husband in all this time since the night of the bridal, she
      turned to Mubarek and said to him, "God upon thee, O Mubarek, tell me, I
      conjure thee by the life of thy lord the Amir, are we yet far from the
      dominions <a href="#linknote-132" name="linknoteref-132"
      id="linknoteref-132"><small>132</small></a> of my bridegroom, the Amir
      Zein ul Asnam?" And he said to her, "Alack, O my lady, it irketh me for
      thee and I will discover to thee that which is hidden. To wit, thou
      deemest that Zein ul Asnam, King of Bassora, is thy bridegroom. Far be it!
      <a href="#linknote-133" name="linknoteref-133" id="linknoteref-133"><small>133</small></a>
      He is not thy bridegroom. The writing of the writ of his marriage with
      thee <a href="#linknote-134" name="linknoteref-134" id="linknoteref-134"><small>134</small></a>
      was but a pretext before thy parents and the folk; and now thou art going
      for a bride to the King of the Jinn, who sought thee from the Amir Zein ul
      Asnam." When the young lady heard these words, she fell a-weeping and Zein
      ul Asnam heard her and fell a-weeping also, a sore weeping, of the excess
      of his love for her. And she said to them, "Is there no pity in you and no
      clemency and have you no fear of God, that I, a stranger maid, you cast me
      into a calamity like this? What answer will you give unto God <a
      href="#linknote-135" name="linknoteref-135" id="linknoteref-135"><small>135</small></a>
      concerning this treason that you have wroughten with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But her weeping and her words availed her nothing, and they ceased not to
      fare on with her till they came to the King of the Jinn, to whom they
      straightway presented her. When he beheld her, she pleased him and he
      turned to Zein ul Asnam and said to him. "Verily, the girl whom thou hast
      brought me is exceeding in beauty and surpassing in loveliness; but the
      goodliness of thy loyalty and shine overmastering of thyself for my sake
      is fairer than she in mine eyes. So return now to thy place and the ninth
      image that thou seekest of me thou shalt find, on thy return, beside the
      other images; for I will send it to thee by one of my slaves of the Jinn."
      Accordingly, Zein ul Asnam kissed the King's hand and returned with
      Mubarek to Cairo; but, when they came thither, he chose not to abide with
      Mubarek longer than a resting-while, of the excess of his longing and his
      yearning to see the ninth image. Withal he ceased not from mourning,
      bethinking him of the young lady and her grace and goodliness; and he fell
      to lamenting and saying, "Alas for the loss of my delights that were
      because of thee, O pearl of beauty and loveliness, thou whom I took from
      thy parents and presented to the King of the Jinn! Alack, the pity of it!"
      And <a href="#linknote-136" name="linknoteref-136" id="linknoteref-136"><small>136</small></a>
      he chid himself for the deceit and the perfidy which he had practised upon
      the young lady's parents and how he had brought her to the King of the
      Jinn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he set out and gave not over journeying till he came to Bassora and
      entering his palace, saluted his mother and told her all that had befallen
      him; whereupon quoth she to him, "Arise, O my son, so thou mayst <a
      href="#linknote-137" name="linknoteref-137" id="linknoteref-137"><small>137</small></a>
      see this ninth image, for that I am exceeding rejoiced at its presence
      with us." So they both descended into the underground hall, wherein were
      the eight images, and found there a great marvel; to wit, instead of the
      ninth image, they beheld the young lady, resembling the sun in her
      loveliness. The prince knew her, when he saw her, and she said to him,
      "Marvel not to find me here in place of that which thou soughtest;
      methinketh thou wilt not repent thee an thou take me in the stead of the
      ninth image." "No, by Allah, oh my beloved!" replied Zein ul Asnam, "For
      that thou art the end of my seeking and I would not exchange thee for all
      the jewels in the world. Didst thou but know the grief which possessed me
      for thy separation, thou whom I took from thy parents by fraud and brought
      thee to the King of the Jinn!" <a href="#linknote-138"
      name="linknoteref-138" id="linknoteref-138"><small>138</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarce had the prince made an end of his speech when they heard a noise of
      thunder rending the mountains and shaking the earth and fear get hold upon
      the queen, the mother of Zein ul Asnam, yea, and sore trembling; but,
      after a little, the King of the Jinn appeared and said to her, "O lady,
      fear not, it is I who am thy son's protector and I love him with an
      exceeding love for the love his father bore me. Nay, I am he who appeared
      to him in his sleep and in this I purposed to try his fortitude, whether
      or not he might avail to subdue himself for loyalty's sake. Indeed the
      beauty of this young lady beguiled him and he could not avail to keep his
      covenant with me so strictly but <a href="#linknote-139"
      name="linknoteref-139" id="linknoteref-139"><small>139</small></a> that he
      desired her for his bride. However, I know the frailty of human nature and
      withal I think greatly of him that he guarded her and kept her unsullied
      and withdrew himself from her; <a href="#linknote-140"
      name="linknoteref-140" id="linknoteref-140"><small>140</small></a>
      wherefore I accept this his constancy and bestow her on him as a bride.
      She is the ninth image, which I promised him should be with him, and
      certes she is fairer than all these images of jewels, inasmuch as her like
      is rarely found in the world." Then the King of the Jinn turned to Zein ul
      Asnam and said to him, "O Prince Zein ul Asnam, this is thy bride; take
      her and go in to her, on condition that thou love her and take not unto
      her a second [wife]; and I warrant thee of the goodliness of her fidelity
      to-thee-ward." Therewithal he vanished from them and Zein ul Asnam went
      out, glad and rejoicing in the young lady; <a href="#linknote-141"
      name="linknoteref-141" id="linknoteref-141"><small>141</small></a> and of
      [the excess of] his love for her he went in to her that night and let
      celebrate the bridal and hold high festival in all the kingdom. Then he
      abode upon the throne of his kingship, judging and commanding and
      forbidding, whilst his bride became queen of Bassora; and after a little
      his mother died. So he made her funeral obsequies <a href="#linknote-142"
      name="linknoteref-142" id="linknoteref-142"><small>142</small></a> and
      mourned for her; after which he lived with his bride in all content till
      there came to them the Destroyer of Delights and the Sunderer of
      Societies.

      ALAEDDIN AND THE ENCHANTED LAMP. <a href="#linknote-143"
      name="linknoteref-143" id="linknoteref-143"><small>143</small></a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      There <a href="#linknote-144" name="linknoteref-144" id="linknoteref-144"><small>144</small></a>
      was [once] in a city of the cities of China a man, a tailor and poor, and
      he had a son by name Alaeddin, who was perverse and graceless from his
      earliest childhood. When he came to ten years of age, his father would
      fain have taught him his own craft, for that, because he was poor, he
      could not spend money upon him to have him taught [another] trade or art
      <a href="#linknote-145" name="linknoteref-145" id="linknoteref-145"><small>145</small></a>
      or the like; <a href="#linknote-146" name="linknoteref-146"
      id="linknoteref-146"><small>146</small></a> so he carried him to his shop,
      that he might teach him his craft of tailoring; but, forasmuch as the lad
      was perverse and wont still to play with the boys of the quarter, <a
      href="#linknote-147" name="linknoteref-147" id="linknoteref-147"><small>147</small></a>
      he would not sit one day in the shop; nay, he would watch his father till
      such time as he went forth the place to meet a customer or on some other
      occasion, when he would flee forth incontinent and go out to the gardens
      with the good-for-nothing lads like himself. This, then, was his case, <a
      href="#linknote-148" name="linknoteref-148" id="linknoteref-148"><small>148</small></a>
      and he would not obey his parents, nor would he learn a craft. His father
      sickened of his grief and chagrin for his son's perversity and died,
      whilst Alaeddin abode on that his wise. When his mother saw that her
      husband had departed this life <a href="#linknote-149"
      name="linknoteref-149" id="linknoteref-149"><small>149</small></a> and
      that her son was a scapegrace and a good-for-nought, she sold the shop and
      all she found therein and fell to spinning cotton and feeding herself and
      her graceless son Alaeddin with her toil. The latter, seeing himself quit
      of his father's danger, <a href="#linknote-150" name="linknoteref-150"
      id="linknoteref-150"><small>150</small></a> redoubled in his gracelessness
      and his perversity and would not abide in their house save eating-whiles;
      and his poor wretched mother supported him <a href="#linknote-151"
      name="linknoteref-151" id="linknoteref-151"><small>151</small></a> by the
      spinning of her hands till he came to fifteen years of age.
    </p>
    <p>
      One <a href="#linknote-152" name="linknoteref-152" id="linknoteref-152"><small>152</small></a>
      day of the days, as he sat in the street, playing with the vagabond boys,
      behold, a Maugrabin <a href="#linknote-153" name="linknoteref-153"
      id="linknoteref-153"><small>153</small></a> dervish came up and stopping
      to look at the lads, singled out Alaeddin from his comrades and fell to
      gazing upon him and straitly considering his favour. Now this dervish was
      from the land of Hither Barbary <a href="#linknote-154"
      name="linknoteref-154" id="linknoteref-154"><small>154</small></a> and he
      was an enchanter who would cast mountain upon mountain with his sorcery
      and was skilled to boot in physiognomy. <a href="#linknote-155"
      name="linknoteref-155" id="linknoteref-155"><small>155</small></a> When he
      had well considered Alaeddin, he said in himself, "Certes, this boy is he
      whom I seek and he it is in quest of whom I came forth from my country."
      So he took one of the lads apart and asked him of Alaeddin, whose son he
      was, and questioned him of all his affairs; after which he went up to
      Alaeddin and taking him aside, said to him, "Harkye, boy, art thou not the
      son of such an one the tailor?" And he answered him, saying "Yes, O my
      lord; but my father died awhile agone." When the Maugrabin magician heard
      this, he threw himself upon Alaeddin and embracing him, fell to kissing
      him and weeping, that his tears ran down upon his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alaeddin was astonished at the Maugrabin's behaviour; so he asked him and
      said to him, "What is the cause of thy weeping, O my lord, and whence
      knewest thou my father?" The Maugrabin answered him, in a mournful, broken
      voice, <a href="#linknote-156" name="linknoteref-156" id="linknoteref-156"><small>156</small></a>
      saying, "How, O my son, canst thou ask me this question, after telling me
      that thy father, my brother, is dead, for thy father was [indeed] my
      brother <a href="#linknote-157" name="linknoteref-157" id="linknoteref-157"><small>157</small></a>
      and I am newly come from my country and was rejoicing exceedingly, after
      this my strangerhood, of my expectation that I should see him and solace
      myself with him; <a href="#linknote-158" name="linknoteref-158"
      id="linknoteref-158"><small>158</small></a> and now thou tellest me that
      he is dead! Marry, blood discovered unto me that <a href="#linknote-159"
      name="linknoteref-159" id="linknoteref-159"><small>159</small></a> thou
      wast the son of my brother, and indeed I knew thee from amongst all the
      lads; although thy father, when I left him, was not yet married. And <a
      href="#linknote-160" name="linknoteref-160" id="linknoteref-160"><small>160</small></a>
      now, O my son Alaeddin," continued he, "I have lost my consolation <a
      href="#linknote-161" name="linknoteref-161" id="linknoteref-161"><small>161</small></a>
      and my joy in thy father, my brother, whom I had hoped, after my
      strangerhood, to see ere I died; but separation hath afflicted me in him
      <a href="#linknote-162" name="linknoteref-162" id="linknoteref-162"><small>162</small></a>
      and there is no fleeing from that which is <a href="#linknote-163"
      name="linknoteref-163" id="linknoteref-163"><small>163</small></a> nor is
      there any resource against the ordinance of God the Most High."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he took Alaeddin and said to him, "O my son, I have no comfort but in
      thee <a href="#linknote-164" name="linknoteref-164" id="linknoteref-164"><small>164</small></a>
      and thou art [to me] in the stead of thy father, since thou art his
      successor and whoso leaveth [a successor] is not dead, O my son." With
      this he put his hand [to his pocket] and bringing out ten diners, gave
      them to Alaeddin, saying, "O my son, where is your house and where is thy
      mother, my brother's wife?" So Alaeddin took him and showed him the way to
      their house; and the magician said to him, "O my son, take these monies
      and give them to thy mother and salute her on my behalf and tell her that
      thine uncle is come back from his strangerhood; and God willing, to-morrow
      I will come visit you, so I may salute her and look upon the house wherein
      my brother dwelt and see where his tomb is." <a href="#linknote-165"
      name="linknoteref-165" id="linknoteref-165"><small>165</small></a>
      Alaeddin kissed his hand and hastened home, running in his joy, to his
      mother and entered, contrary to his wont, for that he was not used to go
      in to her save at eating-times. So he went in to her, rejoicing, and said
      to her, "O my mother, I bring thee glad news of my uncle, in that he is
      come back from his absence, and he saluteth thee." "O my son," quoth she,
      "meseemeth thou makest mock of me. Who is thine uncle and whence hast thou
      an uncle on life?" And he said to her, "O my mother, why didst thou tell
      me that I had no uncles and no kinsfolk on life? Indeed, this man is my
      uncle and he embraced me and kissed me, weeping, and bade me tell thee of
      this." And she answered him, saying, "Yes, O my son, I knew thou hadst an
      uncle, but he is dead and I know not that thou hast a second uncle."
    </p>
    <p>
      As <a href="#linknote-166" name="linknoteref-166" id="linknoteref-166"><small>166</small></a>
      for the Maugrabin enchanter, he went forth at dawn and fell to searching
      for <a href="#linknote-167" name="linknoteref-167" id="linknoteref-167"><small>167</small></a>
      Alaeddin, for that he might not brook parting from him; <a
      href="#linknote-168" name="linknoteref-168" id="linknoteref-168"><small>168</small></a>
      and as he went about in the thoroughfares of the city, he came upon the
      lad, who was playing with the vagabonds, as of his wont. So he went up to
      him and taking him by the hand, embraced him and kissed him; then he
      brought out of his purse two diners and said to Alaeddin, "Go to thy
      mother and give her these two diners and say to her, 'My uncle would fain
      sup with us; so take these two diners and make a good supper.' But first
      show me once more the way to your house." "On my head and eyes, O my
      uncle," answered Alaeddin and foregoing him, showed him the way to the
      house. Then the Maugrabin left him and went his way, whilst Alaeddin
      returned home and telling his mother [what had passed], gave her the two
      diners and said to her, "My uncle would fain sup with us." So she arose
      forthright and went out to the market, where she bought all that was
      needful and returning home, borrowed of her neighbours that which she
      required of platters and the like and proceeded to make ready for supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the time of the evening-meal came, she said to Alaeddin, "O my son,
      the supper <a href="#linknote-169" name="linknoteref-169"
      id="linknoteref-169"><small>169</small></a> is ready and maybe shine uncle
      knoweth not the way to the house. Go thou and meet him." And he answered
      her with "Hearkening and obedience." But, whilst they were in talk,
      behold, there came a knocking at the door; whereupon Alaeddin went out and
      opening, found the Maugrabin enchanter, and with him a slave bearing wine
      and fruits. So he brought them in and the slave went his way, whilst the
      Maugrabin entered and saluted Alaeddin's mother; then he fell a-weeping
      and said to her, "Where is the place in which my brother was wont to sit?"
      She pointed him to her husband's sitting-place, whereupon he went thither
      and prostrating himself, fell to kissing the earth and saying, "Alas, how
      scant is my delight and how sorry my fortune, since I have lost thee, O my
      brother and apple <a href="#linknote-170" name="linknoteref-170"
      id="linknoteref-170"><small>170</small></a> of mine eye!" And the abode on
      this wise, weeping and lamenting, till Alaeddin's mother was certified
      that he was in earnest and that he was like to swoon of the excess of his
      wailing and his lamentation. So she came to him and raised him from the
      ground, saying, "What profiteth it that thou shouldst kill thyself?" And
      <a href="#linknote-171" name="linknoteref-171" id="linknoteref-171"><small>171</small></a>
      she proceeded to comfort him and made him sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, before she laid the table, the Maugrabin fell to relating to her
      [his history] and said to her, "O wife of my brother, let it not amaze
      thee that in all thy days thou never sawest me neither knewest of me in my
      late brother's lifetime, for that I left this country forty years agone
      and became an exile from my native land. I journeyed to the lands of Hind
      and Sind and all the country of the Arabs and coming presently into Egypt,
      sojourned awhile in the magnificent city [of Cairo], which is the wonder
      of the world. <a href="#linknote-172" name="linknoteref-172"
      id="linknoteref-172"><small>172</small></a> Ultimately I betook myself to
      the land of Hither Barbary <a href="#linknote-173" name="linknoteref-173"
      id="linknoteref-173"><small>173</small></a> and sojourned there thirty
      years' space, <a href="#linknote-174" name="linknoteref-174"
      id="linknoteref-174"><small>174</small></a> till one day of the days, as I
      sat, <a href="#linknote-175" name="linknoteref-175" id="linknoteref-175"><small>175</small></a>
      O wife of my brother, I bethought me of my country and my native place and
      of my late brother and longing waxed on me to see him and I fell a-weeping
      and lamenting over my strangerhood and distance from him. In fine, my
      yearning for him importuned me till I resolved to journey to this country,
      the which was the falling-place of my head <a href="#linknote-176"
      name="linknoteref-176" id="linknoteref-176"><small>176</small></a> and my
      native land, that I might see my brother. And I said in myself, "O man,
      how long wilt thou be an exile <a href="#linknote-177"
      name="linknoteref-177" id="linknoteref-177"><small>177</small></a> from
      thy country and thy native place, whenas thou hast an only brother and no
      more? Arise and journey and look upon him ere thou die. Who knoweth the
      calamities of fate and the vicissitudes of the days? Sore pity 'twere that
      thou shouldst die and not see thy brother. Moreover, Allah (praised be He)
      hath given thee abundant wealth and it may be thy brother is in poor case
      and straitened, and thou wilt help him, an <a href="#linknote-178"
      name="linknoteref-178" id="linknoteref-178"><small>178</small></a> thou
      see him." So I arose forthright and equipped myself for travel; then,
      reciting the Fatiheh <a href="#linknote-179" name="linknoteref-179"
      id="linknoteref-179"><small>179</small></a>, I took horse, after the
      Friday prayer, and came, after many hardships and fatigues,&mdash;which I
      suffered, till the Lord (to whom belong might and majesty) protected [me],&mdash;to
      this city. I entered it and as I went about its thoroughfares the day
      before yesterday, I saw my brother's son Alaeddin playing with the boys;
      and by Allah the Great, O wife of my brother, when I saw him, my heart
      crave to him, for that blood yearneth unto blood, and my soul foreboded me
      he was my brother's son. At his sight I forgot all my toils and troubles
      and was like to fly for joy; then, when he told me that my late brother
      had departed to the mercy of God the Most High, I swooned away for stress
      of grief and chagrin; and most like he hath told thee of that which
      overcame me. <a href="#linknote-180" name="linknoteref-180"
      id="linknoteref-180"><small>180</small></a> But I comforted myself
      somewhat with Alaeddin, who standeth in stead of <a href="#linknote-181"
      name="linknoteref-181" id="linknoteref-181"><small>181</small></a> the
      departed, for that whoso leaveth [a successor] <a href="#linknote-182"
      name="linknoteref-182" id="linknoteref-182"><small>182</small></a> dieth
      not."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, <a href="#linknote-183" name="linknoteref-183" id="linknoteref-183"><small>183</small></a>
      when he saw her weeping at this speech, he turned to Alaeddin, by way of
      making her forget the mention of her husband and feigning to comfort her,
      so he might the better accomplish his device upon her, and said to him, "O
      my son Alaeddin, what hast thou learned of crafts and what is thy
      business? Hast thou learned thee a trade whereby thou mayst live, thou and
      thy mother?" At this Alaeddin was confounded and abashed and hung down his
      head, bowing it to the ground, whilst his mother said to the Maugrabin,
      "How? By Allah, he knoweth nought at all! So graceless a lad I never saw.
      All day long he goeth about with the vagabond boys of the quarter like
      himself; nay, his father, woe is me, died not but of his chagrin
      concerning him; and now, as for me, my case is woeful. I spin cotton and
      toil night and day, to earn two cakes of bread, that we may eat them
      together. This, then, is his condition, O my brother-in-law, and by thy
      life, he cometh not in to me save at eating-times, and I am thinking to
      bolt the door of my house and not open to him and let him go seek his
      living for himself, for that I am grown an old woman and have no strength
      left to toil and provide for the maintenance of a fellow like this. <a
      href="#linknote-184" name="linknoteref-184" id="linknoteref-184"><small>184</small></a>
      By Allah, I get mine own livelihood, I that need one who shall maintain
      me." <a href="#linknote-185" name="linknoteref-185" id="linknoteref-185"><small>185</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Therewithal the Maugrabin turned to Alaeddin and said to him, "How is
      this, O son of my brother? It is a disgrace to thee to go vagabonding
      about in this abjection. This befitteth not men like thee. Thou art gifted
      with understanding, O my son, and the child of [reputable] folk; <a
      href="#linknote-186" name="linknoteref-186" id="linknoteref-186"><small>186</small></a>
      I and it is a shame upon thee that thy mother, who is an old woman, should
      toil for thy maintenance, now thou art grown a man. Nay, it behoveth thee
      get thee some means whereby thou mayst maintain thyself, O my son. See, by
      God's grace, (praised be He) here in our city be masters of crafts,
      nowhere is there a place more abounding in them: choose, then, the craft
      which pleaseth thee and I will establish thee therein, so that, when thou
      growest up, O my son, thou mayst find thee thy craft whereby thou shalt
      live. Belike thou hast no mind to thy father's trade; so choose other than
      it. Tell me the craft which pleaseth thee and I will help thee in all that
      is possible, O son of my brother." Then, seeing that Alaeddin was silent
      and answered him nothing, he knew that he had no mind to any craft at all
      and recked of nothing but vagabondage and said to him, "O son of my
      brother, be not abashed at me; <a href="#linknote-187"
      name="linknoteref-187" id="linknoteref-187"><small>187</small></a> if so
      be withal <a href="#linknote-188" name="linknoteref-188"
      id="linknoteref-188"><small>188</small></a> thou caress not to learn a
      trade, I will open thee a merchant's shop of the costliest stuffs and thou
      shalt make thyself acquainted with <a href="#linknote-189"
      name="linknoteref-189" id="linknoteref-189"><small>189</small></a> the
      folk <a href="#linknote-190" name="linknoteref-190" id="linknoteref-190"><small>190</small></a>
      and shalt give and take and sell and buy and become known in the city."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Alaeddin heard these words of his uncle the Maugrabin, to wit, that
      it was his intent to make him a merchant, <a href="#linknote-191"
      name="linknoteref-191" id="linknoteref-191"><small>191</small></a> a
      trader, <a href="#linknote-192" name="linknoteref-192" id="linknoteref-192"><small>192</small></a>
      he rejoiced exceedingly, well knowing that all merchants' apparel is neat
      and elegant; <a href="#linknote-193" name="linknoteref-193"
      id="linknoteref-193"><small>193</small></a> so he looked at the Maugrabin
      and smiled and bowed his head, as who should say, "I am content." The <a
      href="#linknote-194" name="linknoteref-194" id="linknoteref-194"><small>194</small></a>
      magician, seeing him smile, knew that he was content to be a merchant and
      said to him, "Since thou art content that I should make thee a merchant
      and open thee a shop, be a man, O son of my brother, and to-morrow, God
      willing, I will take thee first to the market and let cut thee an elegant
      suit of clothes such as merchants wear; and after that I will look thee
      out a shop and perform my promise to thee." Now Alaeddin's mother was in
      some little doubt as to the Maugrabin; but, when she heard his promise to
      her son that he would open him a shop as a merchant with stuffs and
      capital and what not else, she concluded that he was in very deed her
      brother-in-law, inasmuch as a stranger would not do thus with her son. So
      she fell to admonishing her son and exhorting him to put away ignorance
      and folly from his head and be a man, and bade him still yield obedience
      to his uncle, as he were his father, and apply himself to make up the time
      which he had wasted in idleness [with] those who were like him, after
      which she arose and laying the table, spread the evening-meal and they all
      sat down and fell to eating and drinking, whilst the Maugrabin talked with
      Alaeddin upon matters of merchandry and the like. Then, when he saw that
      the night was far spent, <a href="#linknote-195" name="linknoteref-195"
      id="linknoteref-195"><small>195</small></a> he arose and went to his
      lodging, promising to return in the morning and take Alaeddin, so he might
      let cut him a merchant's suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alaeddin slept not that night for joy and when it was morning, behold, the
      Maugrabin knocked at the door. The lad's mother arose and opened to him;
      however, he would not enter, but sought Alaeddin, that he might take him
      with him to the market. So Alaeddin went out to him and gave him
      good-morning and kissed his hand; whereupon the Maugrabin took him by the
      hand and going with him to the market, entered the shop of a seller of all
      manner of clothes and demanded a suit of costly stuffs. The merchant
      brought him what he sought, all sewn and ready, and the Maugrabin said to
      Alaeddin, "Choose that which pleaseth thee, O my son." Alaeddin rejoiced
      exceedingly, when he saw that his uncle gave him his choice, and chose
      clothes to his mind, such as pleased him. The Maugrabin at once paid the
      merchant their price and going out, carried Alaeddin to the bath, where
      they bathed and came forth and drank wine. <a href="#linknote-196"
      name="linknoteref-196" id="linknoteref-196"><small>196</small></a> Then
      Alaeddin arose and donned the new suit; whereat he rejoiced and was glad
      and coming up to his uncle, kissed his hand and thanked him for his
      bounties. After <a href="#linknote-197" name="linknoteref-197"
      id="linknoteref-197"><small>197</small></a> this the Maugrabin carried him
      to the bazaar of the merchants and showed him the market and the selling
      and buying and said to him, "O my son, it behoveth thee consort with the
      folk, especially with the merchants, so thou mayst learn of them
      merchandry, since this is become thy craft."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he took him again and showed him the city and the mosques and all the
      sights of the place; after which he carried him to a cook's shop, where
      the morning-meal was set before them in silver platters. So they ate and
      drank till they had enough and going forth, fared on, whilst the Maugrabin
      proceeded to show Alaeddin the pleasaunces and fine buildings, <a
      href="#linknote-198" name="linknoteref-198" id="linknoteref-198"><small>198</small></a>
      going in with him to the Sultan's palace and showing him all the fair and
      fine quarters <a href="#linknote-199" name="linknoteref-199"
      id="linknoteref-199"><small>199</small></a> [of the city]; after which he
      carried him to the Khan of the stranger merchants, where he himself
      lodged. and invited certain of the merchants who were in the Khan.
      Accordingly they came and sat down to supper, and he informed them that
      this was his brother's son and that his name was Alaeddin. Then, after
      they had eaten and drunken, the night being now come, the Maugrabin arose
      and taking Alaeddin, carried him back to his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she saw her son as he were one of the merchants, her wit fled [and
      she waxed] sorrowful for gladness and fell to extolling the Maugrabin's
      bounty and saying to him, "O my brother-in-law, I might not suffice [to
      thy deserts,] though I thanked thee all my life long and praised thee for
      the good thou hast done with my son." "O wife of my brother," answered he,
      "this is no manner of kindness in me, <a href="#linknote-200"
      name="linknoteref-200" id="linknoteref-200"><small>200</small></a> for
      that this is my son and it behoveth me stand in the stead of my brother
      his father; so be thou easy." Quoth she, "I pray God, by the glory of the
      ancients <a href="#linknote-201" name="linknoteref-201"
      id="linknoteref-201"><small>201</small></a> and the moderns, that He let
      thee [live] and continue thee, O my brother-in-law, and prolong me thy
      life, so thou mayst be [as] a wing <a href="#linknote-202"
      name="linknoteref-202" id="linknoteref-202"><small>202</small></a> to this
      orphan boy; and he shall still be under thine obedience and thy
      commandment and shall do nought but that which thou biddest him." "O wife
      of my brother," rejoined the Maugrabin, "Alaeddin is a man of
      understanding and [the son of] decent folk, and my hope is in God that he
      will follow in his father's footsteps and be the solace of shine eyes; <a
      href="#linknote-203" name="linknoteref-203" id="linknoteref-203"><small>203</small></a>
      but it irketh me that, to-morrow being Friday, I cannot open him a shop.
      It being congregation day, all the merchants will go out after prayers to
      the gardens and pleasaunces; but, God willing, on Saturday, an it please
      the Creator, we will do our business. Tomorrow I will come to you and take
      Alaeddin, that I may show him the gardens and pleasaunces without the
      city,&mdash;it may be he hath not yet seen them,&mdash;and he shall see
      the merchant-folk and the notables a-pleasuring there, so he may become
      acquainted with them and they with him." <a href="#linknote-204"
      name="linknoteref-204" id="linknoteref-204"><small>204</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="#linknote-205" name="linknoteref-205" id="linknoteref-205"><small>205</small></a>
      Maugrabin lay the night in his lodging; and on the morrow he came to the
      tailor's house and knocked at the door. Alaeddin&mdash;of the excess of
      his joy in the clothes he had donned and of the pleasures he had enjoyed
      on the past day, what with the bath and eating and drinking and viewing
      the folk and the thought that his uncle was coming in the morning to take
      him and show him the gardens&mdash;slept not that night neither closed an
      eye and thought the day would never break. <a href="#linknote-206"
      name="linknoteref-206" id="linknoteref-206"><small>206</small></a> So,
      when he heard a knocking at the door, he went out at once in haste, like a
      spark of fire, and opening, found his uncle the Maugrabin. The latter
      embraced him and kissed him and took him by the hand, saying, "O son of my
      brother, to-day I will show thee a thing such as thou never sawest in thy
      life." Then they went off together and the Maugrabin fell to making merry
      with <a href="#linknote-207" name="linknoteref-207" id="linknoteref-207"><small>207</small></a>
      Alaeddin and amusing him with familiar talk. They went forth the gate of
      the city and the Maugrabin proceeded to walk with him among the gardens
      and to show him the fine pleasaunces and marvellous high-builded palaces;
      and whenassoever they looked upon a garden or a palace <a
      href="#linknote-208" name="linknoteref-208" id="linknoteref-208"><small>208</small></a>
      or a pavilion, <a href="#linknote-209" name="linknoteref-209"
      id="linknoteref-209"><small>209</small></a> he would stand and say to
      Alaeddin, "Doth this please thee, O my son Alaeddin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Alaeddin was like to fly for joy, inasmuch as he saw that which he had
      never in his life seen, and they gave not over walking and gazing till
      they were weary, when they entered a fine garden there, that cheered the
      heart and brightened the eye with its springs <a href="#linknote-210"
      name="linknoteref-210" id="linknoteref-210"><small>210</small></a> welling
      up among flowers and its waters issuing from the mouths of lions of brass
      like unto gold, and sitting down by a lake, rested awhile. As for
      Alaeddin, he rejoiced and was exceeding glad and fell a-jesting with the
      Mangrabin and making merry with him, as he were his uncle in very deed.
      Then the latter arose and loosing his girdle, brought out therefrom a bag
      full of victual and fruit and the like and said to Alaeddin, "O son of my
      brother, thou art maybe anhungred; come, eat what thou wilt." So Alaeddin
      proceeded to eat and the Maugrabin with him and they were gladdened and
      refreshed and their souls were cheered. Then said the Maugrabin, "Rise, O
      my son, an thou be rested, so we may walk a little and fare onward." <a
      href="#linknote-211" name="linknoteref-211" id="linknoteref-211"><small>211</small></a>
      So Alaeddin arose and the Maugrabin walked on with him from garden to
      garden till they had passed them all and came to a high mountain. <a
      href="#linknote-212" name="linknoteref-212" id="linknoteref-212"><small>212</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Alaeddin had never gone forth the gate of the city nor in all his life
      had he walked the like of that walk; so he said to the Maugrabin, "O my
      uncle, whither are we going? See, we have left all the gardens behind us
      and are come to the foot of a mountain. <a href="#linknote-213"
      name="linknoteref-213" id="linknoteref-213"><small>213</small></a> If the
      way be [yet] far, I have no strength left me for walking, for that I am
      worn out with fatigue and there remain no more gardens before us; so let
      us turn back and return to the city." "O my son," replied the Maugrabin,
      "this is the way and the gardens are not yet at an end, for we are going
      <a href="#linknote-214" name="linknoteref-214" id="linknoteref-214"><small>214</small></a>
      to view a garden, whose like is not with the kings and compared with which
      all these which thou hast seen are as nothing. So gird up thy loins <a
      href="#linknote-215" name="linknoteref-215" id="linknoteref-215"><small>215</small></a>
      for walking; praised be God, thou art a man." And he fell to amusing him
      with fair words and telling him rare stories, true and false, till they
      reached the place at which this Maugrabin enchanter aimed and in quest
      whereof he was come from Barbary <a href="#linknote-216"
      name="linknoteref-216" id="linknoteref-216"><small>216</small></a> to the
      land of China; whereupon, "O son of my brother," quoth he to Alaeddin,
      "sit and rest thee; this is the place for which we were making; and now,
      please God, I will show thee marvellous things, the like whereof no one in
      the world hath seen, nor hath any looked upon that which thou art about to
      behold. But <a href="#linknote-217" name="linknoteref-217"
      id="linknoteref-217"><small>217</small></a> do thou, after thou art
      rested, arise and seek sticks and grass and reeds and such like matters as
      are small and dry, so we may kindle a fire, and I will cause thee look, O
      son of my brother, upon a thing which passeth understanding." <a
      href="#linknote-218" name="linknoteref-218" id="linknoteref-218"><small>218</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      When Alaeddin heard this, he yearned to see what his uncle was about to
      do; so he forgot his fatigue and rising forthright, fell to gathering
      brushwood and dry sticks and gathered till the Maugrabin said to him,
      "Enough, O son of my brother." Then he brought out of his pocket a casket,
      from which he took what he needed of perfumes, and proceeded to make
      fumigations and conjurations, speaking words that might not be
      understanded; and straightway it darkened and thundered and the earth
      quaked and opened. At this Alaeddin was sore affrighted and would have
      fled; which when the Maugrabin enchanter saw, he was exceeding, incensed
      at him, for that without Alaeddin his labour was of none avail, since the
      treasure whereat he sought to come might not be opened save by means of
      the lad. So, when he saw him offer to flee, he rose to him and lifting his
      hand, smote him on his head, that he came nigh to knock out his teeth;
      whereupon Alaeddin swooned away and fell upon the earth; but, after a
      little, he recovered his senses, by the virtue of the Maugrabin's
      enchantments, and falling a-weeping, said to him, "O my uncle, what have I
      done to deserve from thee this blow?" The Maugrabin proceeded to soothe
      him and said to him, "O my son, it is my desire to make thee a man; so
      cross me not, for that I am thine uncle and as it were thy father;
      wherefore do thou obey me in that which I shall say to thee, and after a
      little thou shalt forget all this travail and annoy, whenas thou lookest
      upon things marvellous."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, when the earth clove in sunder before the enchanter, there appeared
      to him an alabaster slab and in it a ring of molten brass; <a
      href="#linknote-219" name="linknoteref-219" id="linknoteref-219"><small>219</small></a>
      so he turned to Alaeddin and said to him, "An thou do that which I shall
      tell thee, thou shalt become richer than all the kings; and on this
      account, O my son, I beat thee, for that here is a treasure and it is in
      thy name, and thou, thou wouldst fain have passed it by and fled. But now
      collect thy wits <a href="#linknote-220" name="linknoteref-220"
      id="linknoteref-220"><small>220</small></a> and see how I have opened the
      earth by my conjurations and incantations. Under <a href="#linknote-221"
      name="linknoteref-221" id="linknoteref-221"><small>221</small></a> yonder
      stone, wherein is the ring, is the treasure whereof I have told thee; so
      do thou put thy hand to the ring and lift the slab, for that none of
      mankind can open it but thou and none but thou can set his foot within
      this treasure, since it is guarded for thee. But needs must thou hearken
      from me that which I shall teach thee and lose not <a href="#linknote-222"
      name="linknoteref-222" id="linknoteref-222"><small>222</small></a> a
      syllable of my speech. Marry, all this, O my son, is for thy good, for
      that this is an exceeding great treasure, the kings of the world possess
      not its like, and it is thine and mine." So poor Alaeddin forgot fatigue
      and beating and weeping, of his amazement at the Maugrabin's speech and
      joy that he should become rich after such a measure that even the kings
      would be no wealthier than he, and said to him, "O my uncle, command me
      all thou wilt, for I will be obedient unto thy commandment." And the
      Maugrabin said to him, "O son of my brother, thou art as my very son, nay,
      dearer, for being my brother's son. I have no kindred other than thyself
      and thou art my natural heir and successor, O my son."
    </p>
    <p>
      Therewith he came up to Alaeddin and kissed him saying, "All these my
      toils, whom do they concern? <a href="#linknote-223" name="linknoteref-223"
      id="linknoteref-223"><small>223</small></a> They are all for thy sake, O
      my son, that I may make <a href="#linknote-224" name="linknoteref-224"
      id="linknoteref-224"><small>224</small></a> thee a man rich and great <a
      href="#linknote-225" name="linknoteref-225" id="linknoteref-225"><small>225</small></a>
      exceedingly; so gainsay me not in aught that I shall tell thee; but go up
      to yonder ring and raise it, as I bade thee." "O my uncle," quoth
      Alaeddin, "this stone is heavy; I cannot raise it of myself, <a
      href="#linknote-226" name="linknoteref-226" id="linknoteref-226"><small>226</small></a>
      so come thou also and help me raise it, for I am little of years." "O son
      of my brother," replied the Maugrabin, "it will not be possible for us to
      do aught, an I help thee, and our toil will be wasted in vain; but do thou
      put thy hand to the ring and raise it and it will immediately come up with
      thee; for, as I said to thee, none may handle it but thou. But, when thou
      raisest it, name thine own name and those of thy father and mother and it
      will straightway rise with thee, nor shalt thou feel its weight."
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, Alaeddin took courage and summoning his resolution, did as
      the Maugrabin bade him and raised the slab with all ease, whenas he
      pronounced his own name and those of his father and his mother. So the
      stone came up and he threw it aside; whereupon <a href="#linknote-227"
      name="linknoteref-227" id="linknoteref-227"><small>227</small></a> there
      appeared to him an underground place and its door, whereas one entered by
      a stair of some dozen steps, and the Maugrabin said to him, "O Alaeddin,
      give heed <a href="#linknote-228" name="linknoteref-228"
      id="linknoteref-228"><small>228</small></a> and do punctually that which I
      shall tell thee, neither fail of aught thereof. Go down with all
      circumspection into yonder vault till thou come to the bottom thereof and
      thou wilt find there a place divided into four chambers, <a
      href="#linknote-229" name="linknoteref-229" id="linknoteref-229"><small>229</small></a>
      in each of which thou wilt see four jars of gold and others of native ore
      and silver. Beware lest thou handle them or take aught therefrom, but pass
      them by till thou come to the fourth chamber, and let not thy clothes or
      thy skirts touch the jars, no, nor the walls, and stay not one moment;
      for, an thou do contrary to this, thou wilt forthright be transformed and
      wilt become a black stone. When thou comest to the fourth chamber, thou
      wilt find there a door; open it and speak the names which thou spokest
      over the slab; then enter and thou wilt find thyself in a garden, all
      adorned with trees and fruits. Thence do thou fare on some fifty cubits in
      the path thou wilt find before thee and thou wilt come to a dais, <a
      href="#linknote-230" name="linknoteref-230" id="linknoteref-230"><small>230</small></a>
      with <a href="#linknote-231" name="linknoteref-231" id="linknoteref-231"><small>231</small></a>
      a stair of some thirty steps. Above the dais thou <a href="#linknote-232"
      name="linknoteref-232" id="linknoteref-232"><small>232</small></a> wilt
      find a lamp hung up; take it and pour out the oil that is therein and put
      it in thy sleeve; <a href="#linknote-233" name="linknoteref-233"
      id="linknoteref-233"><small>233</small></a> and fear not for thy clothes
      therefrom, for that it <a href="#linknote-234" name="linknoteref-234"
      id="linknoteref-234"><small>234</small></a> is not oil. And as thou
      returnest, thou mayst pluck from the trees what thou wilt, for that it is
      thine, what while the lamp abideth in thy hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Maugrabin had made an end of his speech, he drew from his finger
      a ring and putting it on Alaeddin's finger, said to him, "And this ring,
      O, my son, shall deliver thee from all hurt and all fear that may betide
      thee, provided thou observe all that I have said to thee. So now arise and
      go down; gird thy loins and summon up thy resolution and fear not, for
      that thou art a man and not a child; and after this, O my son, thou shalt
      in a little time become the richest of mankind." So Alaeddin arose and
      going down into the underground, found the four chambers and in each four
      jars of gold. He passed them by with all care and precaution, even as the
      Maugrabin had bidden him, and entering the garden, fared on there through
      till he came to the dais and mounting the stair, entered <a
      href="#linknote-235" name="linknoteref-235" id="linknoteref-235"><small>235</small></a>
      and found the lamp. So he quenched it and pouring out the oil that was
      therein, put it in his sleeve; then, going down into the garden, he fell
      to gazing upon its trees, whereon were birds extolling with their songs <a
      href="#linknote-236" name="linknoteref-236" id="linknoteref-236"><small>236</small></a>
      the perfection of the Great Creator, and he had not seen them as he
      entered. Now the fruits of these trees were all precious stones, each tree
      bearing fruit of one colour and kind of jewel, and these fruits were of
      all colours, green and white and yellow and red and what not else of
      colours. Their glitterance outshone the rays of the sun in its forenoon
      splendour and the bigness of each jewel overpassed description; suffice it
      that not one of them might be found with the greatest of the kings of the
      world, <a href="#linknote-237" name="linknoteref-237" id="linknoteref-237"><small>237</small></a>
      no, nor a gem half the bigness of the smallest that was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alaeddin <a href="#linknote-238" name="linknoteref-238"
      id="linknoteref-238"><small>238</small></a> entered among the trees and
      proceeded to gaze upon them and upon these things which amazed the sight
      and ravished the sense and observing them, saw that, instead of fruits,
      they bore magnificent jewels from the mines, emeralds and diamonds and
      rubies and pearls and topazes <a href="#linknote-239"
      name="linknoteref-239" id="linknoteref-239"><small>239</small></a> and the
      like of precious stones, such as confounded the wit. Now, for that this
      was a thing Alaeddin had never in his life seen, neither was he of ripe
      age, so he should know the value of these jewels, by reason of his being
      yet a young lad, he thought that they were all glass or crystal; so he
      gathered of them what filled his sleeves <a href="#linknote-240"
      name="linknoteref-240" id="linknoteref-240"><small>240</small></a> and
      fell to looking an they were grapes or figs and the like of fruits that
      might be eaten or not; but, finding them like glass, he proceeded to
      gather in his sleeve <a href="#linknote-241" name="linknoteref-241"
      id="linknoteref-241"><small>241</small></a> of every kind that was upon
      the trees, albeit he knew not jewels nor their worth, saying in himself,
      since he had been baulked in his intent of eating, "I will gather of these
      fruits of glass and will play with them at home." Accordingly he proceeded
      to pluck and put in his pockets <a href="#linknote-242"
      name="linknoteref-242" id="linknoteref-242"><small>242</small></a> and his
      sleeves <a href="#linknote-243" name="linknoteref-243" id="linknoteref-243"><small>243</small></a>
      till he filled them; after which he filled his girdle with the fruits and
      girt himself withal; in fine, he carried off as much as he might,
      purposing to lay them up with him in the house by way of ornament, for
      that he thought them glass, as I have said. Then he quickened his pace, of
      his fear of his uncle the Maugrabin, and hastened through the four
      chambers and the [outer] vault nor looked, as he returned, at the jars of
      gold, albeit he might now have taken of them. <a href="#linknote-244"
      name="linknoteref-244" id="linknoteref-244"><small>244</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came to the stair <a href="#linknote-245" name="linknoteref-245"
      id="linknoteref-245"><small>245</small></a> and ascended it and there
      remained to him but a small matter, to wit, the last step, which was much
      higher than the others, he could not avail to mount it of himself, having
      regard to that which he was carrying; so he said to the Maugrabin, "O my
      uncle, give me thy hand and help me up." Quoth he, "O my son, give me the
      lamp and lighten thyself; maybe it is that which hindereth thee." "Nay, O
      my uncle," answered Alaeddin, "the lamp hindereth me nought; but do thou
      give me thy hand and when I am up, I will give thee the lamp." The
      enchanter, who wanted the lamp and that only, fell to urging Alaeddin to
      give it him; but the latter, having wrapped it within his clothes, with
      purses <a href="#linknote-246" name="linknoteref-246" id="linknoteref-246"><small>246</small></a>
      of jewel-fruits atop of it, <a href="#linknote-247" name="linknoteref-247"
      id="linknoteref-247"><small>247</small></a> could not reach it with his
      hand, so he might give it him. <a href="#linknote-248"
      name="linknoteref-248" id="linknoteref-248"><small>248</small></a> The <a
      href="#linknote-249" name="linknoteref-249" id="linknoteref-249"><small>249</small></a>
      Maugrabin was instant with him to give him the lamp and was like to lose
      his wits for rage, seeing he attained not his object, albeit Alaeddin
      still promised him that he would give it him as soon as he was forth of
      the vault, [and that] without lying thought or ill intent. Then, when he
      saw that Alaeddin would not give it him, he was angry with an exceeding
      anger and abandoning all hope of the lamp, conjured and enchanted and cast
      perfumes into the midst of the fire; whereupon the slab immediately turned
      over <a href="#linknote-250" name="linknoteref-250" id="linknoteref-250"><small>250</small></a>
      and shut <a href="#linknote-251" name="linknoteref-251"
      id="linknoteref-251"><small>251</small></a> of itself by the might of his
      enchantments; the earth covered it like as it was before and Alaeddin
      abode under the ground, unable to come forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the enchanter&mdash;forasmuch as he was a stranger and no uncle of
      Alaeddin, as he said, but had counterfeited himself and avouched leasing,
      so he might get the lamp by means of the lad, unto whom that treasure was
      fortuned by the stars-shut up <a href="#linknote-252"
      name="linknoteref-252" id="linknoteref-252"><small>252</small></a> the
      earth upon him and left him to die of hunger. Now this accursed Maugrabin
      wizard was from the city of Africa <a href="#linknote-253"
      name="linknoteref-253" id="linknoteref-253"><small>253</small></a> in Hither
      Barbary and had from his childhood been addicted to magic and all the
      occult arts, for which the city in question is renowned. He ceased not
      from his tenderest years to study and learn in his native land Africa till
      he became versed in all sciences, and of the much skill and proficiency
      which he acquired, by dint of study and application for the space of forty
      years, in the matter of incantations and conjurations, it was discovered
      to him, <a href="#linknote-254" name="linknoteref-254" id="linknoteref-254"><small>254</small></a>
      one day of the days, that among the uttermost of the cities of China was a
      city called El Kelaas and in this city a vast treasure, the like whereof
      no king of the kings of the world ever possessed; but the rarest [was]
      that in this treasure [was] <a href="#linknote-255" name="linknoteref-255"
      id="linknoteref-255"><small>255</small></a> a wonderful lamp, <a
      href="#linknote-256" name="linknoteref-256" id="linknoteref-256"><small>256</small></a>
      whereat if one should come, there might no man be found on earth richer
      than he, whether in might or in wealth, nor might the greatest king in the
      world avail unto aught of the riches of this lamp and its puissance and
      virtue. Moreover <a href="#linknote-257" name="linknoteref-257"
      id="linknoteref-257"><small>257</small></a> he saw that this treasure was
      to be achieved by means of a lad of mean birth, by name Alaeddin, who was
      of the city aforesaid, and that it was eath to take and unarduous: so he
      tarried not, but equipped himself forthright for the voyage to China, as
      we have said, and did that which he did with Alaeddin, thinking to come by
      the lamp. But his endeavour was baffled and his expectation baulked and
      his toil wasted in vain; whereupon he sought to kill Alaeddin and closed
      up the earth upon him by his sorcery, so he might die (and the live hath
      no slayer <a href="#linknote-258" name="linknoteref-258"
      id="linknoteref-258"><small>258</small></a>); moreover, he purposed by
      this that Alaeddin should not come forth and that the lamp should not be
      brought up from under the earth. Then he went his ways and returned to his
      country Africa, woeful and despairing of his hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for the enchanter and as for what came of Alaeddin, after the
      earth closed over him, he fell to calling upon the Maugrabin, whom he
      thought his uncle, to give him his hand, so he might come forth the
      underground to the surface of the earth; but, when he found that none
      returned him an answer, he was ware of the cheat which the Maugrabin had
      put upon him and knew that he was none of his uncle, but a liar and a
      sorcerer. Therewith he despaired of his life and knew, to his woe, that
      there was no more going forth for him upon the face of the earth; so he
      fell to weeping and lamenting over that which had befallen him. Then,
      after a little, he arose and went down, that he might see if God the Most
      High had vouchsafed him a door whereby he might go forth; and he went
      seeking right and left, but saw nought save darkness and four walls shut
      upon him; for that the Maugrabin sorcerer had by his enchantments locked
      all the doors and had even shut up the garden, so he might leave him no
      door whereby he should come forth upon the face of the earth and so hasten
      his death upon him. Alaeddin's weeping redoubled and his lamentation waxed
      when he saw all the doors shut and eke the garden, for that he thought to
      solace himself with them <a href="#linknote-259" name="linknoteref-259"
      id="linknoteref-259"><small>259</small></a> a little; but he found them
      locked, so he fell to crying out and weeping, as he whose hope is cut off,
      and returning, sat down upon the steps of the stair whereby he had entered
      the vault, weeping <a href="#linknote-260" name="linknoteref-260"
      id="linknoteref-260"><small>260</small></a> and wailing; and indeed he had
      lost hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is a small matter for God (extolled be His perfection and exalted
      be He) whenas He willeth a thing, to say to it "Be," and it is; for that
      He createth relief out of the midst of stress; by token that, when the
      Maugrabin enchanter sent Alaeddin down into the vault, he gave him a ring
      and put it on his finger, saying, "This ring will deliver thee from all
      stress, an thou be in calamities or vicissitudes, and will remove from
      thee troubles; yea, it will be thy helper whereassoever thou art;" and
      this was by the foreordinance of God the Most High, so it might be the
      means of Alaeddin's deliverance. So, as he sat weeping and bewailing his
      case and indeed his hope was cut off of life and despair was heavy upon
      him, he fell, of the excess of his anguish, to wringing <a
      href="#linknote-261" name="linknoteref-261" id="linknoteref-261"><small>261</small></a>
      his hands, after the wont of the woeful; then, raising them [to heaven],
      he made supplication to God, saying, "I testify that there is no God but
      Thou alone, the Mighty, the Powerful, the Conquering, the Giver of Life
      and Death, <a href="#linknote-262" name="linknoteref-262"
      id="linknoteref-262"><small>262</small></a> Creator and Accomplisher <a
      href="#linknote-263" name="linknoteref-263" id="linknoteref-263"><small>263</small></a>
      of necessities, Resolver of difficulties and perplexities and Dispeller
      thereof, <a href="#linknote-264" name="linknoteref-264"
      id="linknoteref-264"><small>264</small></a> Thou my sufficiency, Thou the
      most excellent Guardian, and I testify that Mohammed is Thy servant and
      Thine apostle. O my God, I conjure Thee, by his <a href="#linknote-265"
      name="linknoteref-265" id="linknoteref-265"><small>265</small></a> glory
      with Thee, deliver me from my extremity."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst he was thus supplicating God and wringing his hands in the excess
      of his affliction for that which had befallen him of calamity, he chanced
      to rub upon the ring, and immediately, behold, a genie <a
      href="#linknote-266" name="linknoteref-266" id="linknoteref-266"><small>266</small></a>
      rose up before him and said to him, "Here am I; thy slave is before thee.
      Seek whatsoever thou wilt, for that I am his slave who hath the ring in
      hand, the ring of my lord." <a href="#linknote-267" name="linknoteref-267"
      id="linknoteref-267"><small>267</small></a> Alaeddin looked and saw a
      Marid, <a href="#linknote-268" name="linknoteref-268" id="linknoteref-268"><small>268</small></a>
      as he were of the Jinn of our lord Solomon, standing before him, and
      shuddered at his frightful aspect; but, when he heard the genie say to
      him, "Seek whatsoever thou wilt, for that I am thy slave, since the ring
      of my lord is on thy hand," he took heart and bethought him of the
      Maugrabin's speech to him, whenas he gave him the ring. So he rejoiced
      exceedingly and took courage and said to him, "O slave of the lord of the
      ring, I will of thee that thou bring me out upon the face of the earth."
      Hardly had he made an end of that his speech when, behold, the earth
      opened and he found himself without, at the door of the treasure, to wit,
      upon the surface of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, he had been three days under the earth, sitting in the treasure in
      the dark; so, when the light of day smote on his face and the rays of the
      sun, he might not unclose his eyes, but took to opening them little by
      little and shutting them again till they became stronger and grew used to
      the light and were cleared of the darkness. Then, <a href="#linknote-269"
      name="linknoteref-269" id="linknoteref-269"><small>269</small></a> seeing
      himself upon the surface of the earth, he rejoiced exceedingly, but
      marvelled to find himself overagainst the entrance of the treasure,
      whereby he went down, whenas the Maugrabin enchanter opened it; and now
      the stone was shut down and the earth levelled, nor was there any sign
      therein of a door. So he redoubled in wonderment and thought himself
      otherwhere; nor was he assured that he was in the very place, till he saw
      whereas they had kindled the fire of sticks and brushwood and whereas the
      Maugrabin enchanter had made his fumigations and conjurations. Then he
      turned right and left and saw the gardens afar off and looked at the way
      and knew it for that by which they had come. So he gave thanks to God the
      Most High, who had brought him out on the earth's face and had delivered
      him from death, after he had given up hope of life. Then he arose and
      fared homeward, by the way which he knew, till he came to the city and
      entering, betook himself to their house and went in to his mother. When he
      saw her, he fell down before her, of the greatness of the joy which
      possessed him for his deliverance, and swooned away for the affright and
      the weariness which he had suffered, more by token that he was weak with
      hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now his mother had been woebegone since he left her and sat wailing and
      weeping for him; so, when she saw him come in to her, she rejoiced in him
      with an exceeding joy, but grief overwhelmed her, whenas she saw him fall
      aswoon upon the earth. However, she wasted no time in vain lamentation,
      but hastened to sprinkle water on his face and sought of her neighbours
      somewhat of perfumes, to which she made him smell. When he was a little
      recovered, he prayed her bring him somewhat to eat, saying to her, "O my
      mother, these three days past I have eaten nothing." So she arose and
      setting before him that which she had ready, said to him, "Rise, O my son,
      eat and restore thyself; and when thou art rested, tell me what hath
      happened to thee and what calamity hath befallen thee. I will not question
      thee now, because thou art weary." So, <a href="#linknote-270"
      name="linknoteref-270" id="linknoteref-270"><small>270</small></a> when he
      had eaten and drunken and had refreshed himself and was rested and
      restored, he said to her, "Alack, mother mine, I have a sore grief against
      thee in that thou leftest me to yonder accursed man, who strove for my
      destruction. Indeed, he sought to kill me; nay, I saw death face to face
      from that accursed wretch, whom thou deemedst mine uncle, and but for God
      the Most High, who delivered me from him, [I had perished]. Marry, both I
      and thou, O my mother, suffered ourselves to be deluded by him after the
      measure of that which the accursed promised to do with me of good and of
      the love which he professed for me. Know, then, O my mother, that this man
      is an accursed Maugrabin enchanter, a liar, a deceiver, an impostor and a
      hypocrite; methinketh the devils that be under the earth are not his
      match, may God put him to shame in every book! <a href="#linknote-271"
      name="linknoteref-271" id="linknoteref-271"><small>271</small></a> Hear, O
      my mother, what this accursed did; nay, all I shall tell thee is truth and
      soothfastness. Do but see the villain's duplicity; bethink thee of the
      promises he made me that he would do me all manner of good <a
      href="#linknote-272" name="linknoteref-272" id="linknoteref-272"><small>272</small></a>
      and the love he professed to me, and how he did all this that he might
      accomplish his purpose; nay, his intent was to kill me, and praised be God
      for my deliverance! Hearken, O my mother, and learn what this accursed one
      did."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he told her all that had befallen him from the time of his leaving
      her, weeping the while for excess of joy; how the Maugrabin brought him to
      the hill, wherein was the treasure, and how he conjured and fumigated.
      "And indeed. O my mother," said he, "there overcame me exceeding fear,
      whenas the hill clove in sunder and the earth opened before me by his
      enchantments; and I quaked with terror at the voice of the thunder which I
      heard and the darkness which befell of his spells and fumigations, and of
      my dismay at these portents, I would have fled. When he saw me offer to
      flee, he reviled me and smote me, dealing me a buffet which caused me
      swoon for pain <a href="#linknote-273" name="linknoteref-273"
      id="linknoteref-273"><small>273</small></a> but, inasmuch as the treasure
      was opened and he could not go down into it himself, seeing he had opened
      it by my means and that it was in name and not for him, he knew, being a
      foul sorcerer, that it might [only] be achieved through me and that this
      adventure was [reserved] for me. <a href="#linknote-274"
      name="linknoteref-274" id="linknoteref-274"><small>274</small></a>
      Accordingly <a href="#linknote-275" name="linknoteref-275"
      id="linknoteref-275"><small>275</small></a> he applied himself to make his
      peace with me, that he might send me down into the treasure, now it was
      opened, and attain his object by my means; and when he sent me down, he
      gave me a ring, which he had on his hand, and put it on my finger. So I
      descended into the treasure and found four chambers, all full of gold and
      silver and the like; but this all was nothing and the accursed one charged
      me take nought thereof. Thence I entered a magnificent garden, <a
      href="#linknote-276" name="linknoteref-276" id="linknoteref-276"><small>276</small></a>
      all full of high trees, whose fruits ravished the wits, O my mother, for
      that they were all of various-coloured crystal, <a href="#linknote-277"
      name="linknoteref-277" id="linknoteref-277"><small>277</small></a> and I
      fared on till I came to the pavilion <a href="#linknote-278"
      name="linknoteref-278" id="linknoteref-278"><small>278</small></a> wherein
      was this lamp; whereupon I took it forthright and quenching it, poured out
      that which was therein."
    </p>
    <p>
      [So saying,] he pulled out the lamp from his sleeve and showed it to his
      mother. Moreover, he showed her the jewels which he had brought from the
      garden. Now there were two great purses <a href="#linknote-279"
      name="linknoteref-279" id="linknoteref-279"><small>279</small></a> full of
      these jewels, whereof not one was to be found with the kings of mankind;
      and Alaeddin knew not their value, but thought that they were glass or
      crystal. "Then, O my mother," continued he, "after I had fetched the lamp
      and had gone forth [the garden] and came to the door of the treasure, I
      cried out to the accursed Maugrabin, who feigned himself my uncle, to give
      me his hand and pull me up, for I was laden with things which weighed me
      down, so that it was not possible for me to mount alone. However, he would
      not give me his hand, but said to me, 'Reach me the lamp that is with
      thee, and after I will give thee my hand and pull thee up.' I, seeing that
      I had put the lamp within my sleeve and the purses atop <a
      href="#linknote-280" name="linknoteref-280" id="linknoteref-280"><small>280</small></a>
      of it, could not reach it to give it to him and said to him, 'O my-uncle,
      I cannot give thee the lamp. When I come up, I will give it to thee.' But
      he would not help me up; nay, he would e'en have the lamp, and his intent
      was to take it from me and turn back the earth over me and destroy me,
      even as he did with me in the end. This, then, O my mother, was what
      befell me from that foul wizard." And he told her all that had passed
      between them from first to last and fell to reviling the Maugrabin with
      all rancour and heat of heart, saying, "Out on this accursed one, this
      foul sorcerer, this hard-hearted oppressor, this inhuman, perfidious,
      hypocritical villain, lacking <a href="#linknote-281"
      name="linknoteref-281" id="linknoteref-281"><small>281</small></a> all
      mercy and ruth!"
    </p>
    <p>
      When <a href="#linknote-282" name="linknoteref-282" id="linknoteref-282"><small>282</small></a>
      Alaeddin's mother heard her son's speech and that which the accursed
      Maugrabin did with him, she said to him, "Yea, verily, O my son, he is a
      misbeliever and a hypocrite, who destroyeth folk with his sorcery; but
      glory <a href="#linknote-283" name="linknoteref-283" id="linknoteref-283"><small>283</small></a>
      to God the Most High, who hath delivered thee from the perfidy and guile
      of this accursed sorcerer, of whom I thought that he was in very deed
      thine uncle." Now, Alaeddin had passed three days without sleep and found
      himself drowsy; so he [withdrew to his chamber and] slept. His mother did
      likewise and Alaeddin ceased not to sleep till next day, <a
      href="#linknote-284" name="linknoteref-284" id="linknoteref-284"><small>284</small></a>
      near noontide, when he awoke and immediately sought somewhat to eat, for
      that he was anhungred; and his mother said to him, "O my son, I have
      nought to give thee to eat, for that all I had by me thou atest yesterday.
      But wait awhile; I have here a little yarn by me and I am going down to
      the market, so I may sell it and buy thee withal somewhat thou mayst eat."
      "O my mother," rejoined Alaeddin, "keep the yarn and sell it not; but give
      me the lamp which I brought home, so I may arise and sell it and with its
      price buy somewhat we may eat. Methinketh it will fetch more than the
      yarn." So she arose and fetched the lamp; but, finding it exceeding dirty,
      she said to him, "O my son, this lamp is dirty, and if we wash it and
      furbish it, it will sell for a better price." Accordingly she took a
      little sand and fell to scouring the lamp withal; but scarce had she begun
      to rub it when there appeared to her one of the Jinn, foul of favour and
      monstrous of make as he were of the giants, and said to her, "Say what
      thou wilt of me. Here am I, thy slave and the slave of whoso hath in his
      hand the lamp; and not I alone, but all the slaves of the wonderful lamp
      that is in thy hand." When she saw his frightful aspect, she trembled and
      fear get hold upon her and her tongue was tied, nor could she return an
      answer, for that she was not used to look upon apparitions like unto this;
      so <a href="#linknote-285" name="linknoteref-285" id="linknoteref-285"><small>285</small></a>
      she fell down aswoon of her terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Alaeddin her son was standing afar off and he had seen the slave of
      the ring which he had rubbed in the treasure; so, when he heard the
      genie's speech to his mother, he hastened to take the lamp from her hand
      and said to him, "O slave of the lamp, I am hungry; my will is that thou
      bring me somewhat I may eat, and be it somewhat good past conceit." <a
      href="#linknote-286" name="linknoteref-286" id="linknoteref-286"><small>286</small></a>
      The genie was absent the twinkling of an eye and [returning,] brought him
      a great costly tray of sheer silver, whereon were twelve platters of
      various kinds and colours <a href="#linknote-287" name="linknoteref-287"
      id="linknoteref-287"><small>287</small></a> of rich meats and two silver
      cups and two flagons <a href="#linknote-288" name="linknoteref-288"
      id="linknoteref-288"><small>288</small></a> of clarified old wine and
      bread whiter than snow; all which he set before him and disappeared. So
      Alaeddin arose and sprinkled rosewater on his mother's face and made her
      smell to strong <a href="#linknote-289" name="linknoteref-289"
      id="linknoteref-289"><small>289</small></a> perfumes; whereupon she
      revived and he said to her, "Rise, O my mother, so we may eat of this food
      that God the Most High hath vouchsafed us." <a href="#linknote-290"
      name="linknoteref-290" id="linknoteref-290"><small>290</small></a> When
      she saw the great silver tray, she marvelled and said to Alaeddin, "O my
      son, who is the generous, the bountiful one that hath sought out our
      hunger <a href="#linknote-291" name="linknoteref-291" id="linknoteref-291"><small>291</small></a>
      and our poverty? Indeed, we are beholden to him. <a href="#linknote-292"
      name="linknoteref-292" id="linknoteref-292"><small>292</small></a>
      Apparently the Sultan hath heard of our case and our wretchedness and hath
      sent us this tray." "O my mother," answered Alaeddin, "this is no time for
      questioning; rise, so we may eat, for we are anhungred."
    </p>
    <p>
      So they arose and sitting down to the tray, proceeded to eat, whilst
      Alaeddin's mother tasted food such as she had never in all her life eaten.
      And they ate diligently <a href="#linknote-293" name="linknoteref-293"
      id="linknoteref-293"><small>293</small></a> with all appetite, for stress
      of hunger, more by token that the food [was such as] is given to kings,
      nor knew they if the tray were precious or not, for that never in their
      lives had they seen the like of these things. When they had made an end of
      eating and were full (and there was left them, over and above what
      sufficed them, [enough] for the evening-meal and for the next day also),
      they arose and washing their hands, sat down to talk; whereupon Alaeddin's
      mother turned to her son and said to him, "O my son, tell me what befell
      of <a href="#linknote-294" name="linknoteref-294" id="linknoteref-294"><small>294</small></a>
      the genie, now that, praised be God, we have eaten of His bounty and are
      satisfied and thou hast no pretext for saying to me, 'I am anhungred.'" So
      he told her all that had passed between himself and the genie, whenas she
      fell down aswoon of her affright; whereat exceeding wonderment took her
      and she said to him, "It is true, then, <a href="#linknote-295"
      name="linknoteref-295" id="linknoteref-295"><small>295</small></a> that
      the Jinn appear to the sons of Adam, though I, O my son, in all my days, I
      have never seen them, and methinketh this is he who delivered thee, whenas
      thou west in the treasure." "Nay, O my mother," answered he, "this was not
      he; he who appeared to thee is the slave of the lamp." "How so, <a
      href="#linknote-296" name="linknoteref-296" id="linknoteref-296"><small>296</small></a>
      O my son?" asked she; and he said, "This slave is other of make than that.
      That was the servant of the ring and this thou sawest is the slave of the
      lamp which was in thy hand." When <a href="#linknote-297"
      name="linknoteref-297" id="linknoteref-297"><small>297</small></a> his
      mother heard this, "Well, well!" cried she. "Then the accursed who
      appeared to me and came nigh to kill me for affright is of the lamp?" "Ay
      is he," answered Alaeddin; and she said to him, "I conjure thee, O my son,
      by the milk thou suckedst of me, that thou cast away from thee both lamp
      and ring, for that they will be to us a cause of exceeding fear and I
      could not endure to see them <a href="#linknote-298" name="linknoteref-298"
      id="linknoteref-298"><small>298</small></a> a second time; nay, their
      commerce is forbidden unto us, for that the prophet (whom God bless and
      keep) warneth us against them." <a href="#linknote-299"
      name="linknoteref-299" id="linknoteref-299"><small>299</small></a> "O my
      mother," answered Alaeddin, "thy speech is on my head and eyes; <a
      href="#linknote-300" name="linknoteref-300" id="linknoteref-300"><small>300</small></a>
      but, as for this that thou sayest, it may not be that I should cast away
      either the lamp or the ring; nay, thou seest that which it <a
      href="#linknote-301" name="linknoteref-301" id="linknoteref-301"><small>301</small></a>
      did with us of good, whenas we were anhungred, and know, O my mother, that
      the lying Maugrabin enchanter, what time I went down into the treasure,
      sought nought of gold nor of silver, whereof the four places were full,
      but charged me bring him the lamp and that only, for that he knew the
      greatness of its virtues; <a href="#linknote-302" name="linknoteref-302"
      id="linknoteref-302"><small>302</small></a> and except he knew it to be
      exceeding of might, he had not toiled and travailed and come from his land
      to this in quest of it, nor had he shut the treasure on me, whenas he
      failed of the lamp, seeing I gave it him not. Wherefore, O my mother, it
      behoveth us keep this lamp and guard it with all care, for that this is
      our support and this it is shall enrich us; and it behoveth us show it not
      unto any. On like wise, as for the ring, it may not be that I should put
      it off from my finger, forasmuch as, but for this ring, thou hadst not
      seen me again on life; nay, I had died under the earth within the
      treasure; so how can I put it off from my hand and who knoweth what may
      happen to me in time to come of error or calamity or shift of the shifts
      of mischance, from which the ring might deliver me? However, of regard for
      thy wish, I will lay up the lamp and let thee not see it henceforth." When
      his mother heard his words and pondered them, she saw them to be just and
      true and said to him, "O my son, do what thou wilt. For my part, I wish
      never to see them nor ever again to behold that loathsome aspect <a
      href="#linknote-303" name="linknoteref-303" id="linknoteref-303"><small>303</small></a>
      which I saw [but now]."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alaeddin <a href="#linknote-304" name="linknoteref-304"
      id="linknoteref-304"><small>304</small></a> and his mother abode two days
      eating of the food which the genie had brought, and when it was finished
      and he knew that there was left them nothing to eat, he arose and taking a
      platter of those which the slave had brought on the tray (now they were of
      fine gold, but Alaeddin knew it not) went with it to the market, where a
      Jew, a man viler than devils themselves, accosted <a href="#linknote-305"
      name="linknoteref-305" id="linknoteref-305"><small>305</small></a> him and
      he gave him the platter. When the Jew saw it, he took Alaeddin aside, so
      none might see him, and examining the platter, found it of fine gold, <a
      href="#linknote-306" name="linknoteref-306" id="linknoteref-306"><small>306</small></a>
      but knew not if Alaeddin was ware of its worth or if he was ignorant
      thereof; so he said to him, "How much, O my lord, for this platter?" And
      Alaeddin answered him, saying, "Thou knowest how much it is worth." The
      Jew was perplexed how much he should give Alaeddin for the platter, by
      reason of his having made him an adroit answer, and bethought himself to
      give him little, but feared lest he should be aware of its value and
      debated with himself if he should give him much. Then said he in himself,
      "Most like he knoweth not its value;" so he brought out of his pocket a
      gold diner and gave it to him. When Alaeddin saw the diner in his hand, he
      took it and went off in haste, whereby the Jew knew that the lad was
      unaware of the value of the plate and repented him sore that he had given
      him a gold diner and not a carat of three-score: <a href="#linknote-307"
      name="linknoteref-307" id="linknoteref-307"><small>307</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Alaeddin tarried not, but went forthright to the baker and
      bought of him bread and changed the diner; then, returning to his mother,
      he gave her the bread and the rest of the money and said to her, "O my
      mother, go and buy us what we need." So she arose and going to the market,
      bought all that they needed and they ate and were cheered. Then,
      whenassoever the price of a platter was spent, Alaeddin would take another
      and carry it to the Jew; on which wise the accursed Jew bought them all of
      him for a small matter and would fain also have reduced the price; but,
      since he had given him a diner the first time, he feared to offer him
      less, lest the lad should go and sell to another <a href="#linknote-308"
      name="linknoteref-308" id="linknoteref-308"><small>308</small></a> and he
      lose that excessive profit. Accordingly, Alaeddin ceased not to sell him
      platter after platter till he had sold them all and there was left him
      only the tray whereon they had been; then, for that it was big and heavy,
      he went and fetched the Jew to the house and brought out to him the tray.
      When he saw it and noted its bigness, he gave Alaeddin ten diners, which
      he took, and the Jew went his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alaeddin and his mother lived upon the ten diners till they came to an
      end; then he arose and bringing out the lamp, rubbed it, whereupon the
      slave of the lamp, to wit, the genie whom he had seen before, appeared to
      him and <a href="#linknote-309" name="linknoteref-309" id="linknoteref-309"><small>309</small></a>
      said to him, "Seek what thou wilt, O my lord, for that I am thy slave and
      the slave of whoso hath with him the lamp." Quoth Alaeddin, "It is my will
      that thou bring me a tray of food like unto that which thou broughtest me
      erewhen, for that I am hungry;" and the slave brought him, in the
      twinkling of an eye, a tray like unto that which he had brought him
      before, and on it twelve magnificent platters full of rich meats, together
      with flagons <a href="#linknote-310" name="linknoteref-310"
      id="linknoteref-310"><small>310</small></a> of clarified wine and bread of
      the finest. Now Alaeddin's mother, when she knew that her son was minded
      to rub the lamp, had gone out, so she might not see the genie again; but,
      after a little, she came in to him and seeing the tray full of silver
      platters, whilst the whole house reeked with the fragrance of the rich
      meats, marvelled and rejoiced; and Alaeddin said to her, "O my mother,
      thou badest me throw away the lamp. See now its uses." "O my son,"
      answered she, "may God prosper him; <a href="#linknote-311"
      name="linknoteref-311" id="linknoteref-311"><small>311</small></a> but
      fain would I not see him." Then they sat down to the tray and ate and
      drank till they were satisfied, laying up that which remained with them
      against the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, when that which was with them of food was finished, Alaeddin arose
      and taking one of the platters under his clothes, went in quest of the
      Jew, so he might sell it to him; but, as chance willed it, he passed by
      the shop of a goldsmith, an honest, pious man, who feared God. When the
      latter saw Alaeddin, he accosted him and said to him, "O my son, what wilt
      thou? This many a time have I seen thee pass hereby and betake thyself to
      such an one, a Jew, and I have seen thee give him certain things. Nay,
      methinketh even now thou hast somewhat with thee and art seeking him, so
      thou mayst sell it to him. But thou knowest not, O my son, that the good
      of the Muslims, believers in the unity of God the Most High, is lawful
      spoil in the eyes of Jews; nay, they still cheat the Muslims and
      especially this accursed one with whom thou dealest and into whose hands
      thou hast fallen. Wherefore, O my son, an thou have with thee aught thou
      wouldst sell, show it to me and fear nothing, for that, by the truth of
      God the Most High, I will give thee its price." Accordingly, Alaeddin
      brought out the platter to the old man, who took it and weighing it in his
      scales, said to him, "Was it the like of this thou usest to sell to the
      Jew?" "Ay," replied Alaeddin, "its like and its brother." "And how much,"
      asked the goldsmith, "useth he to give thee to its price?" And Alaeddin
      said, "He useth to give me a diner."
    </p>
    <p>
      When <a href="#linknote-312" name="linknoteref-312" id="linknoteref-312"><small>312</small></a>
      the goldsmith heard this, "Out on this accursed one," cried he, "who
      fleeceth the servants of God the Most High!" Then he looked at Alaeddin
      and said to him, "O my son, this Jew is a cheat, who hath cheated thee and
      laughed at thee, for that the silver of this thy platter is pure and fine;
      and I have weighed it and find its worth threescore diners and ten; so, an
      it please thee take its price, take [it]." Accordingly, he counted out to
      him seventy diners and he took them and thanked him for his kindness, in
      that he had shown him the Jew's trickery. Thenceforward, whenassoever the
      price of one platter was spent, he would carry another to the old
      goldsmith, and on this wise he and his mother increased in substance; but
      they ceased not to live at their sufficiency, <a href="#linknote-313"
      name="linknoteref-313" id="linknoteref-313"><small>313</small></a> midwise
      [betwixt rich and poor], <a href="#linknote-314" name="linknoteref-314"
      id="linknoteref-314"><small>314</small></a> without excessive spending <a
      href="#linknote-315" name="linknoteref-315" id="linknoteref-315"><small>315</small></a>
      or squandering. As for Alaeddin, he left idleness and the commerce of
      striplings and took to consorting with grown men; <a href="#linknote-316"
      name="linknoteref-316" id="linknoteref-316"><small>316</small></a> nay, he
      would go every day to the market of the merchants and sit with the great
      and the small of them and question of the ways and fashions of commerce
      and the prices of articles of merchandise <a href="#linknote-317"
      name="linknoteref-317" id="linknoteref-317"><small>317</small></a> and
      otherwhat. He used also to go to the market of the goldsmiths and the
      market of the jewellers, and there he would sit and look upon the
      different kinds of jewels and see them bought and sold; whereby he became
      aware that the fruits of the trees, wherewith he had filled the purses, <a
      href="#linknote-318" name="linknoteref-318" id="linknoteref-318"><small>318</small></a>
      whenas he was in the treasure, were neither glass nor crystal, but jewels,
      and knew that he had happened upon great wealth, such as kings might
      nowise compass. Moreover, he noted all the jewels that were in the
      jewellers' market, but saw not [among] the biggest [of them] one to match
      with the smallest of those he had at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ceased not to go daily to the market of the jewellers and to clap up
      acquaintance with the folk, making friends with them and questioning them
      of buying and selling and giving and taking and dear and cheap, till, one
      day of the days, he arose in the morning and donning his clothes, went
      forth, intending, as of wont, for the jewellers' market; but, as he went,
      he heard the crier proclaiming aloud on this wise, "By commandment of the
      Lord of Beneficence, the king of the age and monarch of the time and the
      tide, let all the folk shut their shops and stores and enter their houses,
      for that the Lady Bedrulbudour, daughter of the Sultan, purposeth to go to
      the bath, and whoso transgresseth the commandment, his punishment shall be
      death and his blood be on his own head." <a href="#linknote-319"
      name="linknoteref-319" id="linknoteref-319"><small>319</small></a> When
      Alaeddin heard this proclamation, he longed to look upon the Sultan's
      daughter and said in himself, "All the folk talk of her grace and
      goodliness, and the uttermost of my desire is to see her." So <a
      href="#linknote-320" name="linknoteref-320" id="linknoteref-320"><small>320</small></a>
      he cast about for a device how he might contrive to see the Lady
      Bedrulbudour and him-seemed he were best stand behind the door of the
      bath, that he might see her face, as she entered. Accordingly he betook
      himself to the bath, awhile in advance, and posted himself behind the
      door, whereas none of the folk might see him.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Presently, the Sultan's daughter came forth and went round about the
city and its thoroughfares and diverted herself by viewing it; then
she repaired to the bath and when she came thither, she lifted her
face-veil, as she entered; whereupon her face shone out, as it were the
resplendent sun or a precious pearl, and she was as saith of her one of
her describers:

   Who sprinkled the kohl of enchantment upon her eyes
        And gathered the bloom of the rose from her cheeks, fruit-wise?
   And who was it let down the curtained night of her hair
        And eke through its glooms made the light of her forehead rise?
</pre>
    <p>
      When she raised the veil from her face and Alaeddin saw her, he said,
      "Verily, her fashion glorifieth the Great Creator and extolled be the
      perfection of Him who made her and graced her with this beauty and
      goodliness!" And his back was cloven in sunder, <a href="#linknote-321"
      name="linknoteref-321" id="linknoteref-321"><small>321</small></a> when he
      saw her; his thought was confounded and his understanding <a
      href="#linknote-322" name="linknoteref-322" id="linknoteref-322"><small>322</small></a>
      dazed and the love of her gat hold upon his whole heart; so he turned back
      and returning home, went in to his mother, like one distraught. She
      bespoke him and he answered her neither yea nor nay; then she brought him
      the morning-meal, as he abode on this wise, and said to him, "O my son,
      what hath betided thee? Doth there ail thee aught? Tell me what hath
      befallen thee, for that, against thy wont, I bespeak thee and thou
      answerest me not."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Alaeddin had been used to think that women were all like his mother
      and he had heard of the beauty of the Lady Bedrulbudour, daughter of the
      Sultan, but had not known what beauty and grace were; so he turned to his
      mother and said to her, "Leave me;" but she was instant with him to come
      and eat. Accordingly, he came forward and ate a little; then, rising, he
      threw himself on his bed and lay musing till break of morn; and on this
      wise he abode all next day. His mother was perplexed at his case,
      unknowing what had befallen him, and bethought herself that belike he was
      sick; so she came up to him and questioned him, saying, "O my son, an thou
      feel aught of pain or otherwhat, tell me, that I may go fetch thee a
      physician, more by token there is presently in the city a physician from
      the land of the Arabs, whom the Sultan hath sent to bring hither, and
      report saith of him that he is exceeding skilful; so [tell me] if thou art
      sick, that I may go and call him to thee."
    </p>
    <p>
      When <a href="#linknote-323" name="linknoteref-323" id="linknoteref-323"><small>323</small></a>
      Alaeddin heard his mother offer to fetch him the physician, he said to
      her, "O my mother, I am well and not sick, but I had thought that women
      were all like unto thee. However, yesterday, I saw the Lady Bedrulbudour,
      the Sultan's daughter, as she went to the bath;" and he told her all that
      had happened to him, adding, "And most like thou heardest the crier
      proclaiming that none should open his shop nor stand in the road, so the
      Lady Bedrulbudour might pass to the bath; but I saw her even as she is,
      for that, when she came to the door of the bath, she lifted her veil, and
      when I noted her favour and viewed that noble form of hers, there befell
      me, O my mother, a passion of yearning for love of her and desire of her
      <a href="#linknote-324" name="linknoteref-324" id="linknoteref-324"><small>324</small></a>
      usurped mine every part; nor can I ever more have ease, except I get her,
      and I purpose, therefore, to demand her of the Sultan her father in the
      way of law and righteousness."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Alaeddin's mother heard her son's speech, she thought little of his
      wit and said to him, "O my son, the name of God encompass thee! Meseemeth
      thou hast lost thy wit; return to thy senses, <a href="#linknote-325"
      name="linknoteref-325" id="linknoteref-325"><small>325</small></a> O my
      son, and be not like the madmen!" "Nay, O my mother," replied he, "I have
      not lost my wits nor am I mad; and this thy speech shall not change that
      which is in my mind, nor is rest possible to me except I get the darling
      of my heart, the lovely Lady Bedrulbudour. And my intent is to demand her
      of her father the Sultan." So she said to him, "O my son, my life upon
      thee, speak not thus, lest one hear thee and say of thee that thou art
      mad. Put away from thee this extravagance: <a href="#linknote-326"
      name="linknoteref-326" id="linknoteref-326"><small>326</small></a> who
      shall undertake an affair like this and demand it of the Sultan? Meknoweth
      not how thou wilt do to make this request of the Sultan, and if thou speak
      sooth, <a href="#linknote-327" name="linknoteref-327" id="linknoteref-327"><small>327</small></a>
      by whom wilt thou make it?" "O my mother," rejoined Alaeddin, "by whom
      [should I make] a request like this, when thou art at hand, and whom have
      I trustier <a href="#linknote-328" name="linknoteref-328"
      id="linknoteref-328"><small>328</small></a> than thyself? Wherefore my
      intent is that thou shalt make this request for me." "O my son," quoth
      she, "God deliver me from this! What, have I lost my wits like thee? Put
      away this thought from thy mind and bethink thee who thou art, O my son,&mdash;the
      son of a tailor, the poorest and least of the tailors in this city, and I
      also am thy mother and my folk are exceeding poor; so how wilt thou dare
      to demand the Sultan's daughter, whom her father would not vouchsafe to
      marry with kings' sons and Sultans, except they were his peers in
      puissance and rank and noblesse; nay, were they one degree less than he,
      he would not give them his daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alaeddin <a href="#linknote-329" name="linknoteref-329"
      id="linknoteref-329"><small>329</small></a> waited till his mother had
      made an end of her speech and said to her, "O my mother, all that thou
      thinkest I know; marry, I know full well that I am the son of poor folk,
      nor may all this thy talk anywise avail to move me from my purpose; but I
      beseech thee, an I be thy very son and thou love me, do me this kindness;
      else wilt thou lose me, for death hasteneth upon me, an I attain not my
      wish of the beloved of my heart. In any case, O my mother, I am thy son."
      When his mother heard his speech, she wept of her concern for him and said
      to him, "Yes, O my son, I am thy mother and thou art my son and the
      darling of my heart; <a href="#linknote-330" name="linknoteref-330"
      id="linknoteref-330"><small>330</small></a> I have none other than thee
      and the extreme of my desire is to rejoice in thee and marry thee. So, an
      thou wilt, I will seek thee a bride of our own rank. But suppose [I do
      this], they <a href="#linknote-331" name="linknoteref-331"
      id="linknoteref-331"><small>331</small></a> [will] ask at once an thou
      have craft or land or trade or garden, so thou mayst live, and what shall
      I answer them. And if I cannot answer poor folk like ourselves, how, O my
      son, shall I dare to seek the King's daughter of China, who hath none
      before him and none after him? Wherefore do thou ponder this matter in
      thine understanding. And who seeketh her? The son of a tailor. <a
      href="#linknote-332" name="linknoteref-332" id="linknoteref-332"><small>332</small></a>
      Indeed, I know that, an I speak of this, it will but be for the increase
      of our ill luck, for that this affair will bring us in great danger with
      the Sultan and belike there will be death therein for thee and for me. As
      for me, how can I adventure upon this danger and this effrontery?
      Moreover, O my son, on what wise shall I demand thee his daughter of the
      Sultan and how shall I avail to go in to him? Nay, if they question me,
      what shall I answer them? Most like they will deem me a madwoman. And
      suppose I gain admission to the presence, what shall I take by way of
      offering to the Sultan's highness? It <a href="#linknote-333"
      name="linknoteref-333" id="linknoteref-333"><small>333</small></a> is
      true, O my son, that the Sultan is clement and rejecteth none that cometh
      to him for protection or craveth a boon of him, for that he is bountiful
      and beneficent unto all, great and small; <a href="#linknote-334"
      name="linknoteref-334" id="linknoteref-334"><small>334</small></a> but he
      bestoweth his favours upon those who are deserving thereof or who have
      done some feat of arms before him or have wrought for the service or
      defence of the realm; and thou, O my son, tell me, what hast thou done for
      <a href="#linknote-335" name="linknoteref-335" id="linknoteref-335"><small>335</small></a>
      the Sultan or the realm, that thou shouldst merit of him this boon? Again,
      this that thou cravest is beyond thy condition; <a href="#linknote-336"
      name="linknoteref-336" id="linknoteref-336"><small>336</small></a> so it
      cannot be that the king will grant thee that which thou seekest. Moreover,
      whoso presenteth himself before the Sultan and craveth favours of him, it
      behoveth him take in his hand somewhat that sorteth with the royal
      dignity; and as I said to thee, how canst thou presume to present thyself
      before the Sultan and seek of him his daughter, without aught thou mayst
      proffer him of that which sorteth with his rank?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O my mother," replied Alaeddin, "thou speakest justly and deemest that
      which is true, <a href="#linknote-337" name="linknoteref-337"
      id="linknoteref-337"><small>337</small></a> and it behoveth me consider
      all that whereof thou mindest me; but, O my mother, the love of the
      Sultan's daughter, the Lady Bedrulbudour, hath entered into the innermost
      of my heart; and there can be no rest for me, except I obtain her.
      Moreover, thou mindest me of somewhat I had forgotten, and that a thing
      which emboldeneth me to seek of him his daughter by thee. Thou sayst, O my
      mother, that I have no gift to present to the Sultan, according to the
      wont of the folk, whilst in fact I have by me a gift and an offering, the
      like whereof methinketh no king ever possessed, no, nor aught to match
      therewith; for <a href="#linknote-338" name="linknoteref-338"
      id="linknoteref-338"><small>338</small></a> thou must know, O my mother,
      that the fruits, which I brought in the purses <a href="#linknote-339"
      name="linknoteref-339" id="linknoteref-339"><small>339</small></a> from
      the treasure and which I deemed glass or crystal, are very jewels,
      methinketh all the kings of the world may not compass the least of them,
      and I, of my companying with the jewellers, know that they are precious
      stones. Wherefore, an thou please, have the goodness to rise and bring me
      such a China dish which we have by us, <a href="#linknote-340"
      name="linknoteref-340" id="linknoteref-340"><small>340</small></a> that I
      may fill it with these jewels, and thou shalt take it as a present to the
      Sultan. By this means I am assured that the thing will be easy to thee,
      and do thou stand before the Sultan and seek of him my desire; but, O my
      mother, an thou refuse to further me with thine endeavour for the
      attainment of my wish of the Lady Bedrulbudour, know that I am a dead man.
      Be not concerned for the gift, for these be exceeding precious jewels, and
      know, O my mother, that I have gone many a time to the market of the
      jewellers and have seen them sell jewels, that had not an hundredth part
      <a href="#linknote-341" name="linknoteref-341" id="linknoteref-341"><small>341</small></a>
      of the beauty of these of ours, at exceeding high prices such as man's wit
      cannot conceive. When, therefore, I saw this, I said [in myself], 'Verily,
      the jewels that are with us are exceeding precious.' So now, O my mother,
      arise, as I bade thee, and fetch me the China dish whereof I bespoke thee,
      that we may range of these jewels therein and see how they show."
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, she arose and brought the China dish, saying in herself, "Let
      us see if my son's speech be true concerning these jewels or not." So she
      set the dish before Alaeddin and he brought out jewels of all kinds from
      the purses and proceeded to range them in the dish till he filled it. When
      it was full, his mother looked at the dish, but could not gaze fixedly
      thereon, for the radiance of the jewels and their lustre and the excess of
      their flashing; so she shut her eyes and her wit was confounded at them;
      yet was she not certified that their value was in very deed so great as
      her son had said, but bethought her that his speech might be true in that
      their like was not found with kings. Then Alaeddin turned to her and said,
      "See, O my mother, this is a magnificent present for the Sultan and I am
      assured that thou wilt get of him exceeding honour and that he will
      receive thee with all consideration. And now, O my mother, there remaineth
      to thee no excuse; so be good enough <a href="#linknote-342"
      name="linknoteref-342" id="linknoteref-342"><small>342</small></a> to take
      this dish and go with it to the palace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O my son," replied she, "true it is that the present is exceedingly
      costly and precious and as thou sayest, none hath the like thereof; but
      who shall dare to come forward and seek of the Sultan his daughter
      Bedrulbudour? Nay, I dare not adventure myself and say to him, 'I want thy
      daughter,' whenas he asketh me, 'What wouldst thou?' Marry, O my son,, my
      tongue will be tied. And grant that Allah make [the thing] possible and I
      take courage and say to him, 'I desire to ally myself to thee by
      [marrying] thy daughter the Lady Bedrulbudour with my son Alaeddin,' they
      will straightway deem me mad and will put me out with ignominy and
      reproach; nay, I need not tell thee that by this I shall fall into danger
      of death, and not I only, but thou also. Withal, O my son, of regard for
      thy wish, needs must I take courage and go; but, O my son, if the King
      receive me and honour me for the gift's sake and I seek of him that which
      thou wilt in <a href="#linknote-343" name="linknoteref-343"
      id="linknoteref-343"><small>343</small></a> the matter of marrying his
      daughter and he ask me, after the wont of the folk, what are thy
      possessions and thy revenues, what shall I say to him? And most like, O my
      son, he will ask me of this ere he ask me of thyself." And Alaeddin said
      to her, "Nay, it cannot be that the Sultan will ask this, whenas he seeth
      the jewels and their magnificence, and it booteth not to think of a thing
      that will not happen. Do thou but rise and seek me his daughter of him and
      proffer him these jewels and sit not magnifying the affair in thy thought
      beforehand. Moreover, O my mother, thou knowest of the lamp which is with
      me and which presently provideth for our livelihood; <a
      href="#linknote-344" name="linknoteref-344" id="linknoteref-344"><small>344</small></a>
      nay, all that I seek of it it will bring me, and I trust by its means I
      shall know how to answer the Sultan, an he ask me of this."
    </p>
    <p>
      They abode in talk of the matter all that night and when the morning
      morrowed, Alaeddin's mother arose and fortified her heart, more by token
      that her son expounded to her somewhat of the properties of the lamp and
      its uses, in that it would bring them all they sought. But, when he saw
      that she heartened herself for that which he set forth to her of its
      virtues, he feared lest she should talk of this to the folk, so he said to
      her, "O my mother, beware lest thou bespeak any of the lamp and its uses,
      for that this is our fortune; be careful <a href="#linknote-345"
      name="linknoteref-345" id="linknoteref-345"><small>345</small></a> and
      exceed not in speech thereof to any one, lest we lose it and lose this our
      present prosperity, for that it is from it." <a href="#linknote-346"
      name="linknoteref-346" id="linknoteref-346"><small>346</small></a> "Have
      no fear for that, O my son," answered she and rising, took the dish
      wherein were the jewels and wrapping it in a fine handkerchief, went forth
      betimes, so she might reach the Divan and enter, ere it became crowded.
      When she came to the palace, the Divan was not yet assembled <a
      href="#linknote-347" name="linknoteref-347" id="linknoteref-347"><small>347</small></a>
      and she saw the Vizier and certain of the chiefs of the state entering the
      presence-chamber. After a while, the Divan being complete with the Viziers
      and the chiefs of the state and officers and Amirs and grandees, the
      Sultan appeared and the Viziers and other the officials and notables
      ranged themselves before him, whilst he sat down on the throne of his
      kingship and all who were present in the Divan stood before him, with
      hands clasped behind them, <a href="#linknote-348" name="linknoteref-348"
      id="linknoteref-348"><small>348</small></a> awaiting his commandment to
      sit. So he bade them be seated and they all sat down, each in his several
      room; then the petitioners <a href="#linknote-349" name="linknoteref-349"
      id="linknoteref-349"><small>349</small></a> presented themselves before
      the Sultan and each affair was decided in its course, <a
      href="#linknote-350" name="linknoteref-350" id="linknoteref-350"><small>350</small></a>
      till the Divan came to an end, when the King rose and entered the palace
      and each went his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      As <a href="#linknote-351" name="linknoteref-351" id="linknoteref-351"><small>351</small></a>
      for Alaeddin's mother, having come before all, she found room to enter,
      but withal none bespoke her, so he should bring her in before the Sultan;
      wherefore she ceased not standing till the Divan broke up and the Sultan
      rose and entered the palace and all went their ways. When she saw the
      Sultan rise from his throne and enter the harem, she took her way homeward
      and returning on her steps, entered her house. Alaeddin, seeing her with
      the dish in her hand, knew that most like some mischance had betided her,
      but cared not to question her till she entered and setting down the dish,
      told him what had passed and finally said to him, "God be praised, O my
      son, I mustered courage to find myself a place in the Divan, albeit I
      could not win to speak with the Sultan to day; but to-morrow, an it please
      God the Most High, I will bespeak him. To-day there were many other folk,
      like myself, unable to get speech of the Sultan; but be easy, O my son;
      to-morrow I will without fail bespeak him on thy behalf, and what happened
      not shall happen." When Alaeddin heard his mother's words, he rejoiced
      with an exceeding joy, albeit, of the excess of his love and longing for
      the Lady Bedrulbudour, he had looked for the matter to be accomplished
      then and there; nevertheless, he used patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      They slept that night and on the morrow Alaeddin's mother arose and went
      with the dish to the Sultan's Divan, but found it closed; so she asked the
      folk and they said to her, "The Sultan holdeth a Divan but thrice a week;"
      wherefore she was compelled <a href="#linknote-352" name="linknoteref-352"
      id="linknoteref-352"><small>352</small></a> to return home. Then she
      proceeded to go every day, and whenas she found the Divan open, she would
      stand before the door, <a href="#linknote-353" name="linknoteref-353"
      id="linknoteref-353"><small>353</small></a> till it broke up, when she
      would return home; and whiles she went and found the Divan closed. <a
      href="#linknote-354" name="linknoteref-354" id="linknoteref-354"><small>354</small></a>
      On this wise she abode a week's space <a href="#linknote-355"
      name="linknoteref-355" id="linknoteref-355"><small>355</small></a> and the
      Sultan saw her at each Divan; so, when she went on the last day [of the
      week] and stood, according to her wont, before the Divan, till it was
      ended, but could not muster courage to enter <a href="#linknote-356"
      name="linknoteref-356" id="linknoteref-356"><small>356</small></a> or say
      aught, the Sultan arose and entering the harem, turned to his chief
      Vizier, who was with him, and said to him, "O Vizier, these six or seven
      days <a href="#linknote-357" name="linknoteref-357" id="linknoteref-357"><small>357</small></a>
      past I have seen yonder old woman come hither at every Divan and I note
      that she still carrieth somewhat under her veil. <a href="#linknote-358"
      name="linknoteref-358" id="linknoteref-358"><small>358</small></a> Hast
      thou any knowledge of her, O Vizier, and knowest thou what is her want?"
      "O our lord the Sultan," replied the Vizier, "verily women are little of
      wit; and most like this woman cometh to complain to thee of her husband or
      one of her folk," The Sultan was not content with the Vizier's reply, but
      bade him, an she came again to the Divan, bring her before him forthright;
      <a href="#linknote-359" name="linknoteref-359" id="linknoteref-359"><small>359</small></a>
      whereupon the Vizier laid his hand on his head and answered, "Hearkening
      and obedience, O our lord the Sultan."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, <a href="#linknote-360" name="linknoteref-360"
      id="linknoteref-360"><small>360</small></a> Alaeddin's mother, albeit she
      was grown exceeding weary and dejected, yet made light of all weariness,
      for her son's sake, and continued, as of her wont, to go every court-day
      and stand in the Divan before the Sultan. <a href="#linknote-361"
      name="linknoteref-361" id="linknoteref-361"><small>361</small></a>
      Accordingly, one day of the days, she went to the Divan, as of her wont,
      and stood before the Sultan; and when he saw her, he called his Vizier and
      said to him, "Yonder is the woman of whom I bespoke thee yesterday; bring
      her now before me, so I may see what her suit is and accomplish unto her
      her occasion." So the Vizier arose forthright and let bring Alaeddin's
      mother in before the Sultan. When she came into the latter's presence, she
      made her obeisance to him and did him reverence, wishing him glory and
      continuance and eternity of prosperity and kissing the ground before him.
      Then said he to her, "O woman, I see thee come every day to the Divan and
      thou speakest not of aught. Tell me an thou have a want, that I may
      accomplish it unto thee;" whereupon she kissed the earth a second time and
      called down blessings upon him, then answered, "Ay, O King of the Age, as
      thy head liveth, I have indeed a want; but before all things do thou give
      me thine assurance, <a href="#linknote-362" name="linknoteref-362"
      id="linknoteref-362"><small>362</small></a> so I may make bold to prefer
      my suit to the hearing of our lord the Sultan, for that belike Thy Grace
      will find it a strange one."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sultan, that he might learn what her suit was and for that he was of
      his nature exceeding clement, gave her his assurance and bidding all who
      were with him go out forthright, abode alone [with her], he and the Grand
      Vizier. Then he turned to her and said, "Tell me thy suit, and the
      assurance <a href="#linknote-363" name="linknoteref-363"
      id="linknoteref-363"><small>363</small></a> of God the Most High be upon
      thee." Quoth she, "O King of the Age, I wish thy pardon also." And he said
      to her, "God pardon thee!" <a href="#linknote-364" name="linknoteref-364"
      id="linknoteref-364"><small>364</small></a> Then said she to him, "O our
      lord the Sultan, I have a son, whose name is Alaeddin, and one day of the
      days he heard the crier proclaim that none should open his shop nor show
      himself in the thoroughfares of the city, <a href="#linknote-365"
      name="linknoteref-365" id="linknoteref-365"><small>365</small></a> for
      that the Lady Bedrulbudour, the daughter of our lord the Sultan, was going
      to the bath. When my son heard this, he wished to see her; so he hid
      himself in a place, whence he might see her well, and this was behind the
      door of the bath. Accordingly, when she came up, he saw her and viewed her
      well, beyond his wish; and from that time till now, O King of the Age,
      life hath not been pleasant to him <a href="#linknote-366"
      name="linknoteref-366" id="linknoteref-366"><small>366</small></a> and he
      will e'en have me seek her of Thy Grace, <a href="#linknote-367"
      name="linknoteref-367" id="linknoteref-367"><small>367</small></a> so thou
      mayst marry her with him, and I cannot do away this conceit from his wit,
      for that the love of her hath gotten possession of his vitals, so that he
      saith to me, 'Know, O mother mine, that, except I attain my desire,
      assuredly I am a dead man.' Wherefore I crave Thy Grace's clemency and
      hope that thou wilt pardon me and my son this effrontery neither be wroth
      with us therefor."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the King heard her story, he fell a-laughing, of his clemency, <a
      href="#linknote-368" name="linknoteref-368" id="linknoteref-368"><small>368</small></a>
      and asked her, "What is that thou hast with thee and what is that bundle?"
      <a href="#linknote-369" name="linknoteref-369" id="linknoteref-369"><small>369</small></a>
      Whereupon she, seeing that he was not angered at her words, but laughed,
      opened the handkerchief forthright and proffered him the dish of jewels.
      When the Sultan saw the jewels (and indeed, whenas she raised the
      handkerchief from them, the Divan became as it were all illumined with
      lamp-clusters and candlesticks), he was amazed and confounded at their
      radiance and fell a-marvelling at their lustre and bigness and beauty; and
      <a href="#linknote-370" name="linknoteref-370" id="linknoteref-370"><small>370</small></a>
      he said, "Never saw I the like of these jewels for beauty and bigness and
      perfection, nor methinketh is one of them found in my treasuries." Then he
      turned to his Vizier and said to him, "How sayst thou, O Vizier? Sawest
      thou ever in thy life the like of these magnificent jewels?" "Never, O our
      lord the Sultan," replied the Vizier, "nor, methinketh, is the least of
      those which be here found in the treasuries of our lord the King." Quoth
      the Sultan, "Doth not he who giveth me these jewels deserve to be
      bridegroom to my daughter Bedrulbudour? Marry, by what I see, meseemeth
      none is worthier of her than he."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Vizier heard the Sultan's words, his tongue was tied for despite
      and he was overcome with exceeding chagrin, forasmuch as the King had
      promised him that he would marry his daughter to his son; so, after a
      little, he said to him, "O King of the age, Thy Grace condescended to
      promise me <a href="#linknote-371" name="linknoteref-371"
      id="linknoteref-371"><small>371</small></a> that the Lady Bedrulbudour
      should be my son's; wherefore it behoveth thine exalted highness appoint a
      delay of three months, <a href="#linknote-372" name="linknoteref-372"
      id="linknoteref-372"><small>372</small></a> and God willing, my son's
      present shall be greater than this." The King, for all he knew that this
      was a thing whereto the Vizier might not avail, no, nor the greatest King,
      <a href="#linknote-373" name="linknoteref-373" id="linknoteref-373"><small>373</small></a>
      nevertheless exercised his clemency <a href="#linknote-374"
      name="linknoteref-374" id="linknoteref-374"><small>374</small></a> and
      granted him the delay he sought; then, turning to the old woman, he said
      to her, "Go to thy son and tell him I give him [my] word that my daughter
      shall be in his name; <a href="#linknote-375" name="linknoteref-375"
      id="linknoteref-375"><small>375</small></a> but needs must I take order
      for her equipment; <a href="#linknote-376" name="linknoteref-376"
      id="linknoteref-376"><small>376</small></a> wherefore it behoveth him
      grant us a delay of three months."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alaeddin's mother took the answer and thanked the Sultan and prayed for
      him, then went forth and fared homeward in haste, flying of her joy, till
      she came to the house and entered. Her son saw her laughing-faced and
      foreboded good news; more by token that she returned forthright and
      tarried not, as on each day past, neither brought back the dish.
      Accordingly he asked her and said to her, "God willing, O my mother, thou
      bringest me good news; the jewels and their value have wrought their work
      and thou wilt have found acceptance with the Sultan; yea, he will have
      shown thee favour and given ear unto thy suit." So she told him all that
      had passed and how the Sultan had received her and had marvelled, both he
      and his Vizier, at the size and beauty of the jewels, and how he had
      promised her that [quoth she] "his daughter shall be in thy name. But, O
      my son, ere he promised me, the Vizier whispered <a href="#linknote-377"
      name="linknoteref-377" id="linknoteref-377"><small>377</small></a> him
      somewhat, whereupon he appointed me for three months hence; and I am
      fearful lest the Vizier be a man of evil disposition, <a
      href="#linknote-378" name="linknoteref-378" id="linknoteref-378"><small>378</small></a>
      who will change the King's mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      When <a href="#linknote-379" name="linknoteref-379" id="linknoteref-379"><small>379</small></a>
      Alaeddin heard his mother's words and how the Sultan had appointed her for
      <a href="#linknote-380" name="linknoteref-380" id="linknoteref-380"><small>380</small></a>
      three months [thence], his heart was lightened and he rejoiced with an
      exceeding joy and said, "Since the Sultan hath promised for <a
      href="#linknote-381" name="linknoteref-381" id="linknoteref-381"><small>381</small></a>
      three months [hence], true, it <a href="#linknote-382"
      name="linknoteref-382" id="linknoteref-382"><small>382</small></a> is
      long, but in any case my joy is great." Then he thanked her for her
      kindness and the pains she had taken <a href="#linknote-383"
      name="linknoteref-383" id="linknoteref-383"><small>383</small></a> and
      said to her, "By Allah, O my mother, it is as I were in a tomb and now
      thou hast raised me up therefrom; and I praise God the Most High, for I am
      presently certified that there is none richer or happier than I in the
      world." Then he waited till two of the three months were past, when his
      mother went out one day of the days, at sundown, to buy oil, and saw the
      markets closed and the city all decorated and the folk setting candles and
      flowers in their windows and saw troops, horse and foot, and mounted
      eunuchs drawn up in state, with cressets and lustres burning. At this
      wonder took her; <a href="#linknote-384" name="linknoteref-384"
      id="linknoteref-384"><small>384</small></a>he went to an oilman's shop
      there open and buying oil of him, said to him, "[I conjure thee] by thy
      life, O uncle, tell me what is toward to-day in this city, that the folk
      are making this decoration and the markets [are shut] and the houses all
      adorned and the troops drawn up in state?" Quoth he, "O woman, methinketh
      thou art a stranger and art not of this city." "Nay," answered she, "but I
      am of this city;" and he said to her, "Thou art of this city and knowest
      not that this is the night of the going in of the Grand Vizier's son to
      the Lady Bedrulbudour, the Sultan's daughter? Nay, he is presently in the
      bath and yonder Amirs and troops are drawn up awaiting him, against he
      come forth, so they may carry him in procession to the palace of the
      Sultan's daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Alaeddin's mother heard this, she was troubled and perplexed in her
      wit how she should do to acquaint her son with this woeful news, for that
      the poor wretch was counting the hours till the three months should be
      ended. So she returned home forthright and going in to Alaeddin, said to
      him, "O my son, I have news to tell thee, but it irketh me for thy chagrin
      therefrom." Quoth he, "Speak; what is the news?" And she said to him, "The
      Sultan hath gone from his promise to thee in the matter of his daughter,
      the Lady Bedrulbudour, for that this very night the Vizier's son goeth in
      to her; and indeed methought at the time, <a href="#linknote-385"
      name="linknoteref-385" id="linknoteref-385"><small>385</small></a> O my
      son, the Vizier would change the Sultan's mind, even as I told thee that
      he bespoke him privily before me." "How knewest thou this," asked
      Alaeddin, "that the Vizier's son goeth in this night to the Lady
      Bedrulbudour?" So she told him all she had seen of the decorations in the
      city, whenas she went to buy the oil, and how the eunuchs and chiefs of
      the state were drawn up awaiting the Vizier's son, against he should come
      forth of the bath, for that this was the night of his going in. When
      Alaeddin heard this, he fell into a fever of chagrin; <a
      href="#linknote-386" name="linknoteref-386" id="linknoteref-386"><small>386</small></a>
      but presently he bethought him of the lamp and rejoiced and said to his
      mother, "By thy life, O my mother, methinketh the Vizier's son shall not
      rejoice in her, as thou deemest. But now leave us be with this talk and go
      lay us the evening-meal, so we may sup; then, when I shall have passed a
      while in my chamber, all shall yet be well."
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, <a href="#linknote-387" name="linknoteref-387"
      id="linknoteref-387"><small>387</small></a> after he had supped, he went
      into his chamber and locking the door on himself, fetched the lamp and
      rubbed it; whereupon the genie at once appeared to him and said, "Seek
      what thou wilt, for I am thy slave and the slave of whoso hath in his hand
      the lamp, I and all the slaves of the lamp." And Alaeddin said to him,
      "Harkye, I sought of the Sultan to marry his daughter, and he appointed me
      for <a href="#linknote-388" name="linknoteref-388" id="linknoteref-388"><small>388</small></a>
      three months' time; however, he abode not by his promise, but gave her to
      the Vizier's son, and the latter purposeth to go in [to her] this night.
      Wherefore I do presently command thee, as thou art a loyal servant of the
      lamp, that this night, whenas thou seest the bride and bridegroom abed
      together, thou take them up in their bed [and bring them] hither. This is
      what I seek of thee." "Hearkening and obedience," answered the genie, "and
      if thou have a service [to require of me] other than this, command me
      whatsoever thou seekest." And Alaeddin said to him, "I have no present
      requirement save that whereof I have bespoken thee." So the slave
      disappeared and Alaeddin returned to finish his supper <a
      href="#linknote-389" name="linknoteref-389" id="linknoteref-389"><small>389</small></a>
      with his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he deemed it time for the genie's coming, he arose and entered his
      chamber; and after a little, the Marid appeared with the bridal pair in
      their bed; whereat Alaeddin rejoiced with exceeding great joy and said to
      the slave, "Bear this gallowsbird hence and couch him in the house of
      easance." <a href="#linknote-390" name="linknoteref-390"
      id="linknoteref-390"><small>390</small></a> The genie accordingly took up
      the bridegroom and couched him in the draught-house; moreover, ere he left
      him, he blew on him a blast wherewith he dried him up, and the Vizier's
      son abode in woeful case. Then he returned to Alaeddin and said to him,
      "An thou need otherwhat, tell me." And Alaeddin said to him, "Return in
      the morning, so thou mayst take them [back] to their place." "Hearkening
      and obedience," answered the genie and was gone; whereupon Alaeddin arose,&mdash;and
      indeed he had scarce believed that the thing should succeed with him,&mdash;and
      when he saw the Lady Bedrulbudour in his house, he entreated her with
      respect, albeit he had long burned for love of her, and said to her, "O
      princess of the fair, think not that I have brought thee hither to soil
      shine honour. God forbid! Nay, it was that I might not let others <a
      href="#linknote-391" name="linknoteref-391" id="linknoteref-391"><small>391</small></a>
      enjoy thee, for that thy father the Sultan gave me his word upon thee; so
      be thou in peace and assurance." As <a href="#linknote-392"
      name="linknoteref-392" id="linknoteref-392"><small>392</small></a> for the
      princess, when she found herself in that mean dark; house and heard
      Alaeddin's words, fear and trembling get hold upon her and she was
      confounded and could return him no answer. Then he arose and putting off
      his clothes, placed a sword between himself and her and lay down by her
      side in the bed, without treason; <a href="#linknote-393"
      name="linknoteref-393" id="linknoteref-393"><small>393</small></a> it
      sufficed him to prevent [the consummation of] her marriage with the
      Vizier's son. Nevertheless, the Lady Bedrulbudour passed the sorriest of
      nights, never in her life had she known a worse; whilst the Vizier's son
      lay in the draught-house and dared not stir for fear of the genie.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was morning, the genie presented himself before Alaeddin, without
      his rubbing the lamp, and said to him, "O my lord, an thou wish aught,
      command me withal, so I may do it on my head and eyes." And Alaeddin bade
      him go carry the bride and bridegroom to their own place. The genie did
      his bidding in the twinkling of an eye and laying the Vizier's son with
      the Lady Bedrulbudour, took them up and set them down in their place in
      the palace, without their seeing any one; but they were like to die of
      fright, when they felt themselves carried from place to place. Hardly had
      the genie set them down and gone out when the Sultan came to visit his
      daughter; and when the Vizier's son heard the door open, he straightway
      sprang out of bed, knowing that none might enter but the Sultan, and
      donned his clothes, <a href="#linknote-394" name="linknoteref-394"
      id="linknoteref-394"><small>394</small></a> albeit this irked him sore,
      for that he would fain have warmed himself a little, having had no time
      [to do so] since he left the draught-house. The <a href="#linknote-395"
      name="linknoteref-395" id="linknoteref-395"><small>395</small></a> Sultan
      came in to his daughter and kissing her between the eyes, gave her
      good-morrow and asked her of her bridegroom and if she was content with
      him; but she returned him no answer and looked at him with a dejected air.
      <a href="#linknote-396" name="linknoteref-396" id="linknoteref-396"><small>396</small></a>
      He bespoke her several times, but she was silent and answered him not a
      word; so he went out from her and going in to the Queen, told her what had
      passed between himself and the Lady Bedrulbudour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen, so she might not leave the Sultan angry with the Lady
      Bedrulbudour, said to him, "O King of the Age, this is the wont of most
      brides, on their wedding-day, to be shamefast and show somewhat of
      coyness. So be not vexed with her and after a day or two she will return
      to herself and proceed to speak with the folk; but now, O King of the Age,
      shame hindereth her from speaking. However, I purpose to go to her and see
      her." Accordingly she arose and donning her clothes, repaired to her
      daughter's apartment. Then, going up to her, she gave her good-morrow and
      kissed her between the eyes; but the Lady Bedrulbudour returned her no
      manner of answer and the Queen said in herself, "Needs must some strange
      thing have befallen her, to trouble her thus." So she asked her, saying,
      "O my daughter, what is the cause of this thy behaviour? Tell me what
      aileth thee, that I come to thee and give thee good-morrow and thou
      returnest me no answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lady Bedrulbudour raised her head and said to her, "Blame me not, O my
      mother; indeed, it behoved me receive thee with all reverence and worship,
      since thou honourest me by coming to me; but I beseech thee hear the cause
      of this my case and see how this night I have passed hath been for me the
      sorriest of nights. Hardly had we lain down, O my mother, when one, whose
      fashion I know not, took up the bed and transported us to a place dark,
      foul <a href="#linknote-397" name="linknoteref-397" id="linknoteref-397"><small>397</small></a>
      and mean." Then she told her mother the queen all that had betided her
      that night and how they had taken her bridegroom, leaving her alone, and
      how after a little there came another youth and lay down in the place of
      her bridegroom, putting a sword between himself and her; "and in the
      morning" [quoth she] "he who had brought us thither returned and taking us
      up, carried us back to our place here: and hardly had he brought us hither
      and left us when my father the Sultan entered and I had neither heart nor
      tongue to answer him for stress of fright and trembling which possessed
      me. And belike my father is vexed with me; wherefore I prithee, O my
      mother, tell him the cause of this my case, so he be not wroth with me for
      my failure to answer him neither blame me, but excuse me."
    </p>
    <p>
      When <a href="#linknote-398" name="linknoteref-398" id="linknoteref-398"><small>398</small></a>
      the queen heard the princess's story, she said to her, "O my daughter,
      beware of <a href="#linknote-399" name="linknoteref-399"
      id="linknoteref-399"><small>399</small></a> telling this tale before any,
      lest they <a href="#linknote-400" name="linknoteref-400"
      id="linknoteref-400"><small>400</small></a> say, 'Verily the Sultan's
      daughter hath lost her wits.' Marry, thou diddest well in that thou
      acquaintedst not thy father with this; and beware, yea [again I say,]
      beware, O my daughter, of telling him thereof." "O my mother," rejoined
      the Lady Bedrulbudour, "indeed, I bespoke thee in sober earnest and have
      not lost my wits; nay, this is what happened to me, and an thou believe it
      not from me, ask my bridegroom." Quoth the queen, "Rise, O my daughter,
      and put away these illusions from thy thought; nay, don thy clothes and
      see the rejoicing that is toward in the town on thine account and the
      festivities that they celebrate in the kingdom for thy sake and hear the
      drums and the singing and look upon the decorations, all in honour of thy
      nuptials, O my daughter." Accordingly, she summoned the tirewomen, who
      dressed the Lady Bedrulbudour and busked her; whilst the Queen went in to
      the Sultan and told him that there had that night betided the princess a
      dream and illusions, saying, "BIame her not for her failure to answer
      thee." Moreover, she sent for the Vizier's son privily and questioned him
      of the affair, whether the Lady Bedrulbudour's speech was true or not; but
      he, of his fear to lose his bride, lest she should go from his hand, said
      to her, "O my lady, I know nothing of that which thou sayest;" wherefore
      the queen was certified that there had betided her daughter illusions and
      a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding rejoicings continued all that day, with dancing-women and
      singing-women, and all the instruments of mirth and minstrelsy were
      smitten, whilst the queen and the Vizier and his son were exceeding
      assiduous in keeping up the festivities, so the Lady Bedrulbudour should
      rejoice and her chagrin be dispelled; nay, they left nought that day of
      that which exciteth unto liesse but they did it before her, so she should
      leave what was in her mind and be cheered. But all this had no effect on
      her and she was silent and thoughtful and confounded at that which had
      befallen her that night. True, the Vizier's son had fared worse than she,
      for that he was couched in the draught-house; but he belied <a
      href="#linknote-401" name="linknoteref-401" id="linknoteref-401"><small>401</small></a>
      the matter and put away that tribulation from his thought, of his fear
      lest he should lose his bride and his rank, <a href="#linknote-402"
      name="linknoteref-402" id="linknoteref-402"><small>402</small></a> more by
      token that all the folk envied him his lot, for the much increase of
      honour it brought him, as also for the exceeding beauty and loveliness of
      the Lady Bedrulbudour.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Alaeddin, he went out that day and saw the rejoicings toward in the
      city and the palace and fell a-laughing, especially when he heard the folk
      speak of the honour which had betided the Vizier's son and the greatness
      of his good luck, in that he was become the Sultan's son-in-law, and the
      exceeding pomp used in his marriage and bridal festivities; and he said in
      himself, "Ye know not, good simple folk that ye are, <a
      href="#linknote-403" name="linknoteref-403" id="linknoteref-403"><small>403</small></a>
      what befell him last night, that ye envy him." Then, when the night came
      in and it was the season of sleep, Alaeddin arose and entering his
      chamber, rubbed the lamp, whereupon the genie appeared to him forthright
      and <a href="#linknote-404" name="linknoteref-404" id="linknoteref-404"><small>404</small></a>
      he bade him bring the princess and her bridegroom, as on the past night,
      ere the Vizier's son should take her maidenhead. The genie delayed not,
      but was absent a little while; and when it was the appointed time, he
      returned with the bed and therein the Lady Bedrulbudour and the Vizier's
      son. With the latter he did as he had done the past night, to wit, he took
      him and couched him in the draught-house, where he deft him parched for
      excess of fright and dismay; whilst Alaeddin arose and placing the sword
      between himself and the Lady Bedrulbudour, lay down and slept till the
      morning, when the genie appeared and restored the twain to their place,
      leaving Alaeddin full of joy at [the discomfiture of] the Vizier's son.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Sultan arose in the morning, he bethought himself to visit his
      daughter Bedrulbudour and see an she should do with him as she had done on
      the past day; so, as soon as he awoke from his sleep, he rose and donning
      his clothes, went to his daughter's chamber and opened the door. Whereupon
      the Vizier's son arose forthright and coming down from the bed, fell to
      donning his clothes, with ribs cracking for cold; for that, when the
      Sultan entered, it was no great while since the genie had brought them
      back. The Sultan went up to his daughter, the Lady Bedrulbudour, as she
      lay abed, and raising the curtain, gave her good morning and kissed her
      between the eyes and asked her how she did. She frowned and returned him
      no answer, but looked at him sullenly, as she were in sorry case. He was
      wroth with her, for that she made him no answer, and thought that
      something had betided her; so he drew the sword and said to her, "What
      hath befallen thee? Either thou shalt tell me what aileth thee or I will
      do away thy life this very moment. Is this the respect that is due to my
      rank and the honour in which thou holdest me, that I bespeak thee and thou
      answerest me not a word?"
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Lady Bedrulbudour knew that her father was angry and saw the
      naked sword in his hand, she was like to swoon for fear; <a
      href="#linknote-405" name="linknoteref-405" id="linknoteref-405"><small>405</small></a>
      so she raised her head and said to him, "Dear <a href="#linknote-406"
      name="linknoteref-406" id="linknoteref-406"><small>406</small></a> my
      father, be not wroth with me, neither be thou hasty in thine anger, for
      that I am excusable in that which thou hast seen from me. <a
      href="#linknote-407" name="linknoteref-407" id="linknoteref-407"><small>407</small></a>
      Do but hearken what hath betided me and I am well assured that, whenas
      thou hearest my story of that which hath happened to me these two nights
      past, thou wilt excuse me and Thy Grace will be moved to compassion upon
      me, as I know from thy love for me." <a href="#linknote-408"
      name="linknoteref-408" id="linknoteref-408"><small>408</small></a> Then
      she acquainted him with all that had befallen her and said to him, "O my
      father, an thou believe me not, ask my bridegroom and he will resolve Thy
      Grace of everything, albeit I know not what they did with him, when they
      took him from my side, nor where they set him." When <a
      href="#linknote-409" name="linknoteref-409" id="linknoteref-409"><small>409</small></a>
      the Sultan heard his daughter's story, he was sore concerned and his eyes
      brimmed with tears; then, sheathing the sword and coming up to her, he
      kissed her and said to her, "O my daughter, why didst thou not tell me
      yesterday, so I might have warded off from thee the torment and affright
      which have befallen thee this night? But no matter; arise and put away
      from thee this thought, and to-night I will set over thee those who shall
      guard thee, so there shall not again befall thee that which befell
      yesternight." Then he returned to his pavilion and sent at once for the
      Vizier, who came and stood before him, awaiting his commands; and the
      Sultan said to him, "O Vizier, how deemest thou of this affair? Most like
      thy son hath told thee what happened to him and to my daughter." "O King
      of the Age," answered the Vizier, "I have not seen my son or yesterday or
      to-day." Whereupon the Sultan acquainted him with all that his daughter
      the Lady Bedrulbudour had told him and said to him, "It is now my will
      that thou enquire of thy son the truth of the case, for it may be my
      daughter knoweth not for fright what happened to her, though methinketh
      her tale is all true." So the Vizier arose and sending for his son, asked
      him of all that the Sultan had told him, if it were true or not.
      Whereupon, "O my father the Vizier," replied the youth, "[God] preserve
      the Lady Bedrulbudour from leasing! <a href="#linknote-410"
      name="linknoteref-410" id="linknoteref-410"><small>410</small></a> Indeed,
      all she saith is true and these two nights past have been for us the
      sorriest of nights, instead of being nights of pleasance and delight.
      Marry, that which befell me was yet worse, for that, instead of sleeping
      with my bride in bed, I lay in the draught-house, a place dark and
      frightful, noisome of smell and accursed, and my ribs were straitened <a
      href="#linknote-411" name="linknoteref-411" id="linknoteref-411"><small>411</small></a>
      with cold." Brief, he told the Vizier all that had befallen him and
      ultimately said to him; "Dear <a href="#linknote-412"
      name="linknoteref-412" id="linknoteref-412"><small>412</small></a> my
      father, I beseech thee speak with the Sultan that he release me from this
      marriage. True, it is great honour for me to be the Sultan's son-in-law,
      more by token that the love of the Lady Bedrulbudour hath gotten
      possession of my vitals, but I cannot avail to endure one more night like
      the two that are past."
    </p>
    <p>
      When <a href="#linknote-413" name="linknoteref-413" id="linknoteref-413"><small>413</small></a>
      the Vizier heard his son's words, he grieved and was exceeding chagrined,
      for that he had thought to greaten his son and advance him by making him
      the King's son-in-law; so he bethought himself and was perplexed anent the
      matter and what was to do therein; <a href="#linknote-414"
      name="linknoteref-414" id="linknoteref-414"><small>414</small></a> and
      indeed it irked him sore that the marriage should be dissolved, for that
      he had long besought <a href="#linknote-415" name="linknoteref-415"
      id="linknoteref-415"><small>415</small></a> the Ten <a href="#linknote-416"
      name="linknoteref-416" id="linknoteref-416"><small>416</small></a> that he
      might compass the like of that affair; <a href="#linknote-417"
      name="linknoteref-417" id="linknoteref-417"><small>417</small></a> so he
      said to his son, "Have patience, O my son, so we may see [how it will be]
      to-night, and we will set over you guards to guard you; but do not thou
      let slip this great honour, for that it hath fallen to none other than
      thyself." Therewith he left him and returning to the Sultan, told him that
      the Lady Bedrulbudour's story was true; whereupon quoth the Sultan, "Since
      the case is thus, we need no wedding-festivities." <a href="#linknote-418"
      name="linknoteref-418" id="linknoteref-418"><small>418</small></a> And he
      bade forthright break off the rejoicings and the marriage was dissolved.
      The folk and the people of the city marvelled at this strange thing,
      especially when they saw the Vizier and his son go forth the palace in a
      pitiable plight for stress of chagrin and despite, and they fell to
      asking, "What hath happened and why is the marriage avoided and the
      rejoicings broken off?" But none knew what was to do save Alaeddin, the
      suitor, <a href="#linknote-419" name="linknoteref-419" id="linknoteref-419"><small>419</small></a>
      who laughed in his sleeve. So the marriage was annulled; but the Sultan
      had forgotten his promise to Alaeddin's mother and never again bethought
      him thereof, neither he nor the Vizier; nor knew they whence came that
      which had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alaeddin waited till the three months had elapsed, after which the Sultan
      had promised that he would marry him to his daughter, the Lady
      Bedrulbudour, then despatched his mother to the Sultan to require him of
      the performance of his promise. So she repaired to the palace and when the
      Sultan came to the Divan and saw her standing before him, he remembered
      his promise to her, that after three months he would marry his daughter to
      her son, and turning to the Vizier, said to him, "O Vizier, yonder is the
      woman who presented us with the jewels and we gave her our word that after
      three months [we would marry our daughter to her son]. Bring her before me
      forthright." So the Vizier went and brought Alaeddin's mother before the
      Sultan; and when she came into the presence, she made her obeisance to him
      and prayed God to vouchsafe him glory and endurance of prosperity. The
      Sultan asked her if she had a need, and she said to him, "O King of the
      Age, the three months are ended, after which thou didst promise me thou
      wouldst marry my son Alaeddin to thy daughter the Lady Bedrulbudour." The
      Sultan was perplexed at this her claim, more by token that he saw her in
      poor case, as she were the meanest of the folk; but the present which she
      had made him was exceeding magnificent [and indeed] beyond price; <a
      href="#linknote-420" name="linknoteref-420" id="linknoteref-420"><small>420</small></a>
      so he turned to the Vizier and said to him, "How deemest thou? What shall
      we do? <a href="#linknote-421" name="linknoteref-421" id="linknoteref-421"><small>421</small></a>
      It is true I gave her my word, but meseemeth they are poor folk and not of
      the chiefs of the people."
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="#linknote-422" name="linknoteref-422" id="linknoteref-422"><small>422</small></a>
      Vizier, who was like to die of envy and chagrin for that which had
      befallen his son, said in himself, "How shall one like this marry the
      Sultan's daughter and my son lose this honour?" So he said to the Sultan,
      <a href="#linknote-423" name="linknoteref-423" id="linknoteref-423"><small>423</small></a>
      "O my lord, it is an easy matter to rid ourselves of <a
      href="#linknote-424" name="linknoteref-424" id="linknoteref-424"><small>424</small></a>
      this vagabond, <a href="#linknote-425" name="linknoteref-425"
      id="linknoteref-425"><small>425</small></a> for that it would not beseem
      Thy Grace to give thy daughter to a man like this, of whom it is not known
      what he is." Quoth the Sultan, "On what wise shall we rid ourselves of
      this man, seeing I have given him my word and a King's word is his bond?"
      "O my lord," answered the Vizier, "my counsel is that thou require of him
      forty dishes of pure virgin gold, full of jewels, such as she <a
      href="#linknote-426" name="linknoteref-426" id="linknoteref-426"><small>426</small></a>
      brought thee the other day, <a href="#linknote-427" name="linknoteref-427"
      id="linknoteref-427"><small>427</small></a> and forty slave-girls to bear
      the dishes and forty black slaves." "By Allah, O Vizier," rejoined the
      Sultan, "'thou speakest rightly; for that this is a thing to which he may
      not avail and so we shall be rid of him by [fair] means." <a
      href="#linknote-428" name="linknoteref-428" id="linknoteref-428"><small>428</small></a>
      So he said to Alaeddin's mother, "Go and tell thy son that I abide by the
      promise which I made him, but an if he avail unto my daughter's dowry; to
      wit, I require of him forty dishes of pure gold, which must all be full of
      jewels [such as] thou broughtest me [erst], together with forty
      slave-girls to carry them and forty male slaves to escort and attend them.
      If, then; thy son avail unto this, I will marry him to my daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Alaeddin's mother returned home, shaking her head and saying, "Whence
      shall my poor son get these dishes of jewels? Supposing, for the jewels
      and the dishes, that he return to the treasure and gather the whole from
      the trees,&mdash;and withal methinketh not it is possible to him; but say
      that he fetch them,&mdash;whence [shall he get] the slaves and
      slave-girls?" And she gave not over talking to herself till she reached
      the house, where Alaeddin awaited her, and when she came in to him, she
      said to him, "O my son, said I not to thee, 'Think not to attain to the
      Lady Bedrulbudour'? Indeed, this is a thing that is not possible unto folk
      like ourselves." Quoth he, "Tell me what is the news." And she said to
      him, "O my son, the Sultan received me with all courtesy, according to his
      wont, and meseemeth he meant fairly by us, but [for] thine accursed enemy
      the Vizier; for that, after I had bespoken the Sultan in thy name, even as
      thou badest me, reminding him that the term for which he had appointed us
      was past and saying to him, 'If Thy Grace would vouchsafe to give
      commandment for the marriage of thy daughter the Lady Bedrulbudour with my
      son Alaeddin,'&mdash;he turned to the Vizier and spoke to him. The Vizier
      replied to him in a whisper and after that the Sultan returned me an
      answer." Then she told him what the Sultan required of him and added, "O
      my son, he would fain have present answer of thee; but methinketh we have
      no answer to give him."
    </p>
    <p>
      When <a href="#linknote-429" name="linknoteref-429" id="linknoteref-429"><small>429</small></a>
      Alaeddin heard his mother's speech, he laughed and said, "O my mother,
      thou sayest we have no answer to make him and deemest the thing exceeding
      hard; but now be good enough to rise <a href="#linknote-430"
      name="linknoteref-430" id="linknoteref-430"><small>430</small></a> and
      fetch us somewhat to eat, and after we have dined, thou shalt (an it
      please the Compassionate) see the answer. The Sultan like thyself,
      thinketh he hath sought of me an extraordinary matter, so he may divert me
      from the Lady Bedrulbudour; but the fact is that he seeketh a thing less
      than I had looked for. But go now and buy us somewhat we may eat and leave
      me to fetch thee the answer." Accordingly, she arose and went out to buy
      her need from the market, so she might make ready the morning-meal; whilst
      Alaeddin entered his chamber and taking the lamp, rubbed it. The genie
      immediately appeared to him and said, "Seek what thou wilt, O my lord;"
      whereupon quoth Alaeddin, "I seek the Sultan's daughter in marriage and he
      requireth of me forty dishes of pure gold, each ten pounds in weight and
      full of the jewels which be in the garden of the treasure, the forty
      dishes to be borne by forty slave girls and each slave-girl to be
      accompanied by a male slave; wherefore I will have thee bring me this, all
      of it." "Hearkening and obedience, O my lord," replied the genie and
      disappearing, was absent awhile, then returned with the forty slave-girls,
      each attended by a male slave and bearing on her head a dish of pure gold,
      full of precious jewels. So he brought them before Alaeddin and said to
      him, "Here is that which thou soughtest. Tell me an thou need thing or
      service other than this." Quoth Alaeddin, "I need nothing [more]; if I
      need aught, I will summon thee and tell thee."
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, the genie vanished and after a little, Alaeddin's mother
      returned and entering the house, saw the slaves and slave-girls; whereat
      she marvelled and said, "All this is of the Lamp; God continue it unto my
      son!" Then, before she put off her veil, Alaeddin said to her, "O my
      mother, this is thy time, ere the Sultan enter his palace [and withdraw]
      to his harem. Take him what he seeketh, and that forthright, so he may
      know that I can avail unto that which he requireth, ay, and more, and that
      he was deluded by the Vizier; albeit he thought to baffle me, he and his
      Vizier." Then he arose and opening the house-door, let out the damsels and
      the slaves, pair by pair, each damsel with a slave by her side, so that
      they filled the street. His mother forewent them and the people of the
      quarter, when they saw that rare and magnificent sight, stood looking and
      marvelling and gazing upon the faces of the slave-girls and their grace
      and goodliness [and their apparel], for that they were clad in clothes all
      inwoven with gold and studded with jewels; nay, the least one's clothes of
      them were worth thousands. Moreover they looked at the dishes <a
      href="#linknote-431" name="linknoteref-431" id="linknoteref-431"><small>431</small></a>
      and saw flashing therefrom a radiance that outshone the light of the sun,
      albeit each dish was covered with a piece of brocade, gold-inwrought and
      studded eke with precious jewels. Alaeddin's <a href="#linknote-432"
      name="linknoteref-432" id="linknoteref-432"><small>432</small></a> mother
      fared on and the damsels and slaves followed after her, in all fair
      ordinance and disposition, whilst the folk stood to gaze on the beauty of
      the slave-girls and extolled the perfection of the Almighty Creator, till
      she reached the palace and entered it with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the eunuchs and chamberlains and captains of the guard saw them,
      wonder took them and they were breathless for amaze at this sight, the
      like whereof they had never in their lives seen, and especially at the
      slave girls, each one of whom would ravish the wit of an anchorite.
      Withal, the chamberlains and captains of the Sultan's guards were all of
      them sons of grandees and Amirs; and they marvelled yet more at the
      damsels' costly raiment and the dishes which they bore on their heads and
      on which they might not open their eyes, <a href="#linknote-433"
      name="linknoteref-433" id="linknoteref-433"><small>433</small></a> for the
      excess of their flashing and radiance. Then the guards <a
      href="#linknote-434" name="linknoteref-434" id="linknoteref-434"><small>434</small></a>
      entered and told the Sultan, who bade bring them before him forthright
      into the Divan. So Alaeddin's mother entered with them and when they came
      before the Sultan, they all did obeisance to him with the utmost
      courtliness and gravity and invoked on him glory and prosperity; then,
      raising the dishes from their heads, they set them down before him and
      stood with their hands clasped behind them, after they had removed the
      covers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sultan wondered with an exceeding wonderment and was confounded at the
      beauty of the girls and their loveliness, which overpassed description;
      his wit was bewildered, when he saw the golden dishes, full of jewels that
      dazzled the sight, and he was amazed at this marvel, so that he became as
      one dumb, unable to speak aught, of the excess of his wonderment; nay, his
      wit was the more perplexed, forasmuch as this had all been accomplished in
      an hour's time. Then he bade carry the slave-girls and their burdens to
      the pavilion of the Lady Bedrulbudour; so the damsels took up the dishes
      and entered; whereupon Alaeddin's mother came forward and said to the
      Sultan, "O my lord, this is no great matter for the Lady Bedrulbudour's
      exalted rank; nay, she deserveth manifold this." So the Sultan turned to
      the Vizier and said to him, "How sayst thou, O Vizier? He that can in so
      short a time avail unto riches like these, is he not worthy to be the
      Sultan's son-in-law and to have his daughter to bride?" Now the Vizier
      marvelled at the greatness of these riches yet more than the Sultan, but
      envy was killing him and waxed on him more and more, when he saw that the
      Sultan was content with the bride-gift <a href="#linknote-435"
      name="linknoteref-435" id="linknoteref-435"><small>435</small></a> and the
      dowry; withal he could not gainstand the [manifest] truth and say to the
      Sultan, "He is not worthy;" so he cast about to work upon him by practice,
      that he might hinder him from giving his daughter the Lady Bedrulbudour to
      Alaeddin, and accordingly said to him, <a href="#linknote-436"
      name="linknoteref-436" id="linknoteref-436"><small>436</small></a> "O my
      lord, all the treasures of the world were not worth a paring of thy
      daughter Bedrulbudour's nails; indeed, Thy Highness overrateth this upon
      her." <a href="#linknote-437" name="linknoteref-437" id="linknoteref-437"><small>437</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      When <a href="#linknote-438" name="linknoteref-438" id="linknoteref-438"><small>438</small></a>
      the Sultan heard the Vizier's words, he knew that this his speech arose
      from the excess of his envy; so he turned to Alaeddin's mother and said to
      her, "O woman, go to thy son and tell him that I accept of him the
      marriage-gift and abide by my promise to him and that my daughter is his
      bride and he my son-in-law; so bid him come hither, that I may make
      acquaintance with him. There shall betide him from me nought but all
      honour and consideration and this night shall be the beginning of the
      bridal festivities. But, as I said to thee, let him come hither to me
      without delay." So she returned home swiftlier than the wind, <a
      href="#linknote-439" name="linknoteref-439" id="linknoteref-439"><small>439</small></a>
      of her haste to bring her son the good news; and she was like to fly for
      joy at the thought that her son was to become the Sultan's son-in-law. As
      soon as she had taken her leave, the Sultan bade break up the Divan and
      entering the Lady Bedrulbudour's pavilion, commanded to bring the damsels
      and the dishes before his daughter and himself, so she should see them. So
      they brought them and when the Lady Bedrulbudour saw the jewels, she was
      amazed and said, "Methinketh there is not one of these jewels found in the
      treasuries of the world." Then she looked at the damsels and marvelled at
      their beauty and grace and knew that this was all from her new bridegroom
      and that he had proffered it to her service. So she rejoiced, albeit she
      had been sad and sorry for her [whilom] bridegroom the Vizier's son,&mdash;she
      rejoiced, [I say], with an exceeding joy, when she saw the jewels and the
      beauty of the damsels, and was cheered; whilst her father rejoiced
      exceedingly in her joy, in that he saw her put off chagrin and dejection.
      Then he said to her, "O my daughter Bedrulbudour, doth this please thee?
      Indeed, methinketh this thy bridegroom is goodlier <a href="#linknote-440"
      name="linknoteref-440" id="linknoteref-440"><small>440</small></a> than
      the Vizier's son, and God willing, O my daughter, thou shalt rejoice with
      him abundantly." <a href="#linknote-441" name="linknoteref-441"
      id="linknoteref-441"><small>441</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for the Sultan and as for Alaeddin, when his mother came to the
      house and entered and he saw her laughing of the excess of her joy, he
      foreboded good news and said, "To God Everlasting <a href="#linknote-442"
      name="linknoteref-442" id="linknoteref-442"><small>442</small></a> be
      praise! Accomplished is that which I sought." And she said to him, "Glad
      tidings, O my son! Let thy heart rejoice and thine eye be solaced in the
      attainment of thy desire, for that the Sultan accepteth thine offering, to
      wit, the bride gift and the dowry of the Lady Bedrulbudour, and she is thy
      bride and this, O my son, is the night of your <a href="#linknote-443"
      name="linknoteref-443" id="linknoteref-443"><small>443</small></a> bridal
      and thy going in to the Lady Bedrulbudour. Nay, the Sultan, that he might
      certify me of his word, proclaimed thee his son-in-law before the folk and
      declared that this should be the wedding-night; but he said to me, 'Let
      thy son come hither to me, so I may make acquaintance with him, and I will
      receive him with all honour and worship.' And now, O my son, my office <a
      href="#linknote-444" name="linknoteref-444" id="linknoteref-444"><small>444</small></a>
      is ended, whatsoever remaineth is a matter for thee." <a
      href="#linknote-445" name="linknoteref-445" id="linknoteref-445"><small>445</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Alaeddin kissed his mother's hand and thanked her amain for her kindness;
      <a href="#linknote-446" name="linknoteref-446" id="linknoteref-446"><small>446</small></a>
      then he arose and entering his chamber, took the lamp and rubbed it;
      whereupon the genie presented himself and said to him, "Here am I; seek
      what thou wilt." Quoth Alaeddin, "My will is that thou take me to a bath,
      whose like is not in the world, and fetch me a suit of royal raiment and
      exceeding costly, such as no king can boast." "Hearkening and obedience,"
      replied the Marid and taking him up, brought him intro a bath, never saw
      King nor Kisra <a href="#linknote-447" name="linknoteref-447"
      id="linknoteref-447"><small>447</small></a> its like, for it was of
      alabaster and agate and full of marvellous limnings that ravished the
      sight, and therein was a saloon all embossed with precious jewels. None
      was there; but, when Alaeddin entered, there came in to him one of the
      Jinn in human semblance and washed him and bathed him to the utmost of the
      wish: after <a href="#linknote-448" name="linknoteref-448"
      id="linknoteref-448"><small>448</small></a> which he went forth the bath
      to the outer saloon, where he found his clothes taken away and in their
      stead a suit of the richest royal apparel. Then sherbets were brought him
      and coffee with ambergris and he drank and arose; whereupon there came to
      him a troop of slaves and clad him in those <a href="#linknote-449"
      name="linknoteref-449" id="linknoteref-449"><small>449</small></a>
      sumptuous clothes <a href="#linknote-450" name="linknoteref-450"
      id="linknoteref-450"><small>450</small></a> and he dressed and perfumed
      himself with essences and sweet-scented smoke. <a href="#linknote-451"
      name="linknoteref-451" id="linknoteref-451"><small>451</small></a> Now
      thou knowest <a href="#linknote-452" name="linknoteref-452"
      id="linknoteref-452"><small>452</small></a> that Alaeddin was the son of a
      poor man, a tailor: yet now none had thought it, <a href="#linknote-453"
      name="linknoteref-453" id="linknoteref-453"><small>453</small></a> but had
      said, "This is the chiefest of the sons of the kings," extolled be the
      perfection of Him who changeth and is not changed!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the slave of the lamp came to him and taking him up, set him down in
      his house and said to him, "O my lord, dost thou need aught?" "Yes,"
      answered Alaeddin; "I will have thee bring me eight-and-forty mamelukes,
      <a href="#linknote-454" name="linknoteref-454" id="linknoteref-454"><small>454</small></a>
      four-and-twenty to walk before me and four-and-twenty to walk behind me,
      with their horses and clothes and arms, and let all that is upon them and
      their horses be of stuffs costly and precious exceedingly, such as are not
      found in kings' treasuries. Then bring me a stallion fit for the riding of
      the Chosroes and be his trappings all of gold, embossed with noble jewels;
      and bring me eight-and-forty thousand diners, in each mameluke's hand a
      thousand, for that I purpose presently to visit the Sultan; wherefore
      delay thou not on me, since I cannot go thither without all that whereof I
      have bespoken thee. Bring me also twelve slave-girls, who must be unique
      in loveliness and clad in the richest of raiment, so they may attend my
      mother to the Sultan's palace, and let each slave-girl have with her a
      suit of apparel fit for the wearing of kings' wives." <a
      href="#linknote-455" name="linknoteref-455" id="linknoteref-455"><small>455</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hearkening and obedience," replied the genie and disappearing, brought
      him in the twinkling of an eye all that he had commanded him withal,
      whilst in his hand he held a stallion, whose like is not among the horses
      of the Arabs of the Arabs, <a href="#linknote-456" name="linknoteref-456"
      id="linknoteref-456"><small>456</small></a> with housings of the richest
      stuffs brocaded with gold; whereupon Alaeddin called his mother forthright
      and delivered her the twelve slave-girls and gave her the [twelve] suits,
      <a href="#linknote-457" name="linknoteref-457" id="linknoteref-457"><small>457</small></a>
      so she might dress herself <a href="#linknote-458" name="linknoteref-458"
      id="linknoteref-458"><small>458</small></a> and go with them to the
      Sultan's palace. Then he despatched one of the mamelukes thither, to see
      an the Sultan were come forth of the harem or not; so he went and
      returning, swiftlier than lightning, said to him, "O my lord, the Sultan
      awaiteth thee." Accordingly he arose and mounting, [set forth], whilst the
      mamelukes rode before him and after him, (extolled be the perfection of
      the Lord who created them with <a href="#linknote-459"
      name="linknoteref-459" id="linknoteref-459"><small>459</small></a> that
      which clothed them of beauty and grace!), strewing gold upon the folk
      before their lord Alaeddin, who overpassed them all of his grace and
      goodliness, and ask thou not of kings' sons, <a href="#linknote-460"
      name="linknoteref-460" id="linknoteref-460"><small>460</small></a>
      extolled be the perfection of the Giver, the Eternal! Now all this was of
      the virtue of the wonderful lamp, <a href="#linknote-461"
      name="linknoteref-461" id="linknoteref-461"><small>461</small></a> which
      gifted whoso possessed it with goodliness and grace and wealth and wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The folk marvelled at Alaeddin's bounty and at the excess of his
      munificence and were amazed when they saw that which graced him of beauty
      and goodliness and his courtliness and dignity; yea, they extolled the
      perfection of the Compassionate One for this His noble creature and all of
      them great and small <a href="#linknote-462" name="linknoteref-462"
      id="linknoteref-462"><small>462</small></a> called down blessings on him,
      albeit they knew him for the son of such an one the tailor; yet none
      envied him, but all said, "He is deserving." So <a href="#linknote-463"
      name="linknoteref-463" id="linknoteref-463"><small>463</small></a> he
      fared on his way, with the mamelukes before him and behind him, scattering
      gold upon the folk, till he came to the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Sultan had summoned to his presence the chiefs of his state and
      telling them that he had passed his word for the marriage of his daughter
      to Alaeddin, bade them await the latter, commanding them that, when he
      came, they should all go out to meet him; moreover, he assembled the amirs
      and viziers and chamberlains and guards and captains of the troops and
      they were all awaiting Alaeddin at the door of the palace. When he
      arrived, he would have dismounted at the door, but there came up to him
      one of the Amirs, whom the Sultan had deputed to that office, and said to
      him, "O my lord, the commandment is that thou enter, riding on thy
      charger, so thou mayst alight at the door of the Divan." So they all
      forewent him and he entered till they brought him to the door of the
      Divan. There sundry of them came forward and held his stirrup, whilst some
      supported him on both sides and other some took him by the hand, and so
      they dismounted him. Then the Amirs and officers of state forewent him and
      brought him into the Divan, till he drew near the Sultan's throne;
      whereupon the latter came down forthright from his seat and embracing him,
      hindered him from kissing the carpet and seated him beside himself on his
      right hand. Alaeddin did that which behoveth and befitteth unto kings of
      obeisance and invocation and said to him, "O our lord the Sultan, thy
      Grace's munificence hath vouchsafed <a href="#linknote-464"
      name="linknoteref-464" id="linknoteref-464"><small>464</small></a> to
      accord me the Lady Bedrulbudour thy daughter, albeit I am unworthy of this
      great favour, for that I am of the lowliest of thy slaves; wherefore I
      beseech God that He keep and continue thee. Indeed, O King, my tongue
      faileth to thank thee [as were behoving] for the greatness of this boon,
      overpassing its competence, <a href="#linknote-465" name="linknoteref-465"
      id="linknoteref-465"><small>465</small></a> wherewith thou hast favoured
      me, and I beseech Thy Grace to vouchsafe me ground, such as is meet, so I
      may build thereon a palace that shall be fit for the Lady Bedrulbudour."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sultan was amazed when he saw Alaeddin in this regal array and beheld
      his grace and goodliness and the mamelukes standing in attendance upon him
      in all their comeliness and fair favour; yea, and his wonderment redoubled
      when Alaeddin's mother came up attired in rich and costly raiment, as she
      were a queen, and he saw twelve slave-girls in her service, preceding her,
      their hands clasped behind their backs, with all worship and observance.
      Moreover, he noted Alaeddin's eloquence and the elegance of his speech and
      was amazed thereat, he and all who were present with him in the Divan,
      whilst fire was kindled in the Vizier's heart for envy of Alaeddin, so
      that he was like to die. Then, after the Sultan had heard Alaeddin's
      compliment and had seen the greatness of his quality and his modesty and
      eloquence, he strained him to his bosom and kissed him, saying, "It irketh
      me, O my son, that I have not known thee <a href="#linknote-466"
      name="linknoteref-466" id="linknoteref-466"><small>466</small></a> before
      to-day." So, <a href="#linknote-467" name="linknoteref-467"
      id="linknoteref-467"><small>467</small></a> when he saw Alaeddin on this
      fashion, he rejoiced in him with an exceeding joy and at once bade the
      music <a href="#linknote-468" name="linknoteref-468" id="linknoteref-468"><small>468</small></a>
      and the drums <a href="#linknote-469" name="linknoteref-469"
      id="linknoteref-469"><small>469</small></a> strike up; then, rising, he
      took him by the hand and carried him into the palace, where the
      evening-meal had been made ready and the servants set the tables. There he
      sat down and seated Alaeddin on his right hand; whereupon the viziers and
      chiefs of the state and the grandees of the realm sat also, each in his
      several room, whilst the drums beat and they held high festival in the
      palace. <a href="#linknote-470" name="linknoteref-470" id="linknoteref-470"><small>470</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sultan proceeded to make familiar with Alaeddin and to talk with him,
      and Alaeddin answered him with all courtliness and fluency, as he had been
      bred in kings' palaces or as he were their constant associate; <a
      href="#linknote-471" name="linknoteref-471" id="linknoteref-471"><small>471</small></a>
      and the more the talk was prolonged between them, the more gladness and
      joy redoubled on the Sultan for that which he heard of the goodliness of
      Alaeddin's answers and the sweetness of his speech. Then, when they had
      eaten and drunken and the tables were removed, the Sultan bade fetch the
      Cadis and the witnesses; so they came and knotted the knot and wrote the
      writ [of marriage] between Alaeddin and the Lady Bedrulbudour. Therewith
      Alaeddin arose and would have taken leave; but the Sultan laid hold on him
      and said to him, "Whither away, O my son? The bride-feast is toward and
      the bride present; the knot is knotted and the writ written." "O my lord
      the king," answered Alaeddin, "I would fain build the Lady Bedrulbudour a
      palace, besorting her rank and station, and it may not be that I should go
      in to her without this; but, God willing, the building shall, by the
      diligent endeavour of thy slave and by Thy Grace's auspice, <a
      href="#linknote-472" name="linknoteref-472" id="linknoteref-472"><small>472</small></a>
      be right speedily despatched. Indeed, I long for present enjoyment of the
      Lady Bedrulbudour; but it behoveth me [first] apply myself to that which
      is incumbent on me for her service." <a href="#linknote-473"
      name="linknoteref-473" id="linknoteref-473"><small>473</small></a> Quoth
      the Sultan, "O my son, look thyself out the ground which thou deemest apt
      to thine end and take it. All is in thy hand; <a href="#linknote-474"
      name="linknoteref-474" id="linknoteref-474"><small>474</small></a>, but
      here before my palace is a spacious piece of ground, which meseemeth were
      best; so, if it please thee, build thou the palace thereon." And Alaeddin
      answered him, saying, "Indeed, it is my utmost desire to be near Thy
      Grace."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he took leave of the Sultan and going forth, mounted and rode, with
      his mamelukes before him and behind him, whilst the folk all prayed for
      him and said, "By Allah, he is deserving!" till he came to his house and
      alighting from his stallion, entered his chamber and rubbed the lamp;
      whereupon the genie stood before him and said to him, "Seek what thou
      wilt, O my lord" Quoth Alaeddin, "I desire of thee an important service,
      to wit, that thou build me with all speed a palace before that of the
      Sultan, which shall be marvellous in its building, never saw kings its
      like, and be it complete with all its requisites of kingly and magnificent
      furniture and so forth." "Hearkening and obedience," replied the genie and
      <a href="#linknote-475" name="linknoteref-475" id="linknoteref-475"><small>475</small></a>
      disappeared; but, before the dawn broke, he came to Alaeddin and said to
      him, "O my lord, the palace is finished to the utmost of the wish;
      wherefore, an thou wouldst see it, arise forthright and look on it." So
      Alaeddin arose and the genie carried him, in the twinkling of an eye, to
      the palace, which when he saw, he was amazed at its building, for that all
      its stones were of jade and alabaster and porphyry and mosaic. The genie
      carried him into a treasury full of all manner of gold and silver and
      precious jewels past count or reckoning, price or estimation; then he
      brought him into another place, where he saw all the requisites of the
      table, platters and spoons and ewers and basins and cups, of gold and
      silver, and thence to the kitchen, where he found cooks, <a
      href="#linknote-476" name="linknoteref-476" id="linknoteref-476"><small>476</small></a>
      with their cooking-gear and utensils, all on like wise of gold and silver.
      Moreover, he brought him into a place, which he found full of coffers
      overflowing with royal raiment, such as ravished the wit, gold-inwoven
      stuffs, Indian and Chinese, and brocades, and he showed him also many
      other places, all full of that which beggareth description, till at last
      he brought him into a stable, wherein were horses whose like is not found
      with the kings of the world; and therewithin he showed him a storehouse,
      full of housings and saddles of price, all broidered with pearls and
      precious stones and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alaeddin was amazed and bewildered at the greatness of these riches,
      whereunto the mightiest king in the world might not avail, and all the
      work of one night; more by token that the palace was full of slaves and
      slave girls such as would bewitch a saint with their loveliness. But the
      most marvellous of all was that he saw in the palace an upper hall <a
      href="#linknote-477" name="linknoteref-477" id="linknoteref-477"><small>477</small></a>
      and <a href="#linknote-478" name="linknoteref-478" id="linknoteref-478"><small>478</small></a>
      a belvedere <a href="#linknote-479" name="linknoteref-479"
      id="linknoteref-479"><small>479</small></a> with four-and-twenty oriels,
      all wroughten of emeralds and rubies and other jewels, and of one of these
      oriels the lattice-work was by his desire left unfinished, <a
      href="#linknote-480" name="linknoteref-480" id="linknoteref-480"><small>480</small></a>
      so the Sultan should fail of its completion. When he had viewed the
      palace, all of it, he rejoiced and was exceeding glad; then he turned to
      the genie and said to him, "I desire of thee one thing which is lacking
      and whereof I had forgotten to bespeak thee." Quoth the slave, "Seek what
      thou wilt, O my lord;" and Alaeddin said to him, "I will have thee bring
      me a carpet Of fine brocade, all inwoven with gold, and spread it from my
      palace to that of the Sultan, so the Lady Bedrulbudour, whenas she cometh
      hither, may walk thereon and not upon the earth." So the genie was absent
      a little and returning, said to him, "O my lord, that which thou soughtest
      of me is here." Therewithal he took him and showed him the carpet, which
      ravished the wit, and it was spread from the Sultan's palace to that of
      Alaeddin; then taking him up, he set him down in his own house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It <a href="#linknote-481" name="linknoteref-481" id="linknoteref-481"><small>481</small></a>
      was now grown high day; so the Sultan arose from sleep and opening a
      window of his pavilion, looked forth and saw buildings <a
      href="#linknote-482" name="linknoteref-482" id="linknoteref-482"><small>482</small></a>
      before his palace; whereupon he fell to rubbing his eyes and opening them
      wide and looking farther, saw a magnificent palace, that bewildered the
      wits, and a carpet spread therefrom to his own palace; as on like wise did
      the doorkeepers and all who were in the palace, and their wits were
      bewildered at the sight. At this juncture the Vizier presented himself and
      as he entered, he espied the new palace and the carpet and marvelled also;
      so, when he came in to the Sultan, the twain fell to talking of this
      strange matter and marvelling, for that they saw a thing which amazed the
      beholder and dilated the heart; and they said, "Verily, methinketh kings
      may not avail unto the building of the like of this palace." Then the
      Sultan turned to the Vizier and said to him, "How now? Deemest thou
      Alaeddin worthy to be bridegroom to my daughter the Lady Bedrulbudour?
      Hast thou seen and considered this royal building and all these riches
      which man's wit cannot comprehend?" The Vizier, of his envy of Alaeddin,
      answered him, saying, "O King of the Age, indeed this palace and its
      building and all these riches may not be but by means of enchantment, for
      that no man among men, no, not the mightiest of them in dominion or the
      greatest in wealth, might avail to upraise and stablish [the like of] this
      building in one night." Quoth the Sultan, "I marvel at thee how thou still
      deemest evil of Alaeddin; but methinketh it ariseth from thine envy of
      him, for that thou wast present when he sought of me a place whereon to
      build a palace for my daughter and I accorded him, before thee, [leave to
      build] a palace on this ground; and he who brought me, to my daughter's
      dower, jewels such that no kings possess one thereof, shall he lack
      ableness to build a palace like this?" When <a href="#linknote-483"
      name="linknoteref-483" id="linknoteref-483"><small>483</small></a> the
      Vizier heard the Sultan's speech and understood that he loved Alaeddin
      greatly, his envy of him increased; withal he availed not to do aught
      against him, so he was dumb and could make the Sultan no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Alaeddin&mdash;seeing that it was high day and that the time was
      come when he should go to the palace, for that his wedding-festivities
      were toward and the Amirs and Viziers and chiefs of the state were all
      with the Sultan, so they might be present at the bridal&mdash;arose and
      rubbed the lamp; whereupon the genie presented himself and said to him, "O
      my lord, seek what thou wilt, for that I am before thee, at thy service."
      Quoth Alaeddin, "I purpose presently to go to the Sultan's palace, and
      to-day is the wedding; wherefore I have occasion for ten thousand diners,
      which I will have thee bring me." The slave was absent the twinkling of an
      eye and returned to him with the money; whereupon Alaeddin arose and
      taking horse, with his mamelukes behind him and before him, rode to the
      palace, scattering gold upon the folk, as he passed, so that they were
      fulfilled with the love of him and the greatness of his munificence. <a
      href="#linknote-484" name="linknoteref-484" id="linknoteref-484"><small>484</small></a>
      When he came to the palace and the Amirs and eunuchs and soldiers, who
      were standing awaiting him, saw him, they hastened forthright to the
      Sultan and told him; whereupon he arose and coming to meet him, embraced
      him and kissed him; then he took him by the hand and carried him into the
      palace where he sat down and seated him on his right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the city was all adorned and the instruments [of music] were smiting
      in the palace and the singing-women singing. Then the Sultan trade serve
      the morning-meal; so the slaves and mamelukes hastened to spread the table
      and it was such as kings might take example by. <a href="#linknote-485"
      name="linknoteref-485" id="linknoteref-485"><small>485</small></a> The
      Sultan sat with Alaeddin and the officers of state and the chiefs of the
      realm and they ate and drank till they were satisfied; and great was the
      rejoicing in the palace and the city. Glad were all the chiefs of the
      state and the folk rejoiced in all the realm, whilst there came from far
      regions the notables of the provinces and the governors of the cities, so
      they might see Alaeddin's wedding and his bride-feast. The Sultan still
      marvelled in himself at Alaeddin's mother, how she had come to him in poor
      clothes, whilst her son had command of this exceeding wealth; and as for
      the folk, who came to the Sultan's palace, to gaze upon the
      wedding-festivities, when they saw Alaeddin's palace and the goodliness of
      its building, there took them great wonderment how so magnificent a
      building had been upreared in one night and they fell all to praying for
      Alaeddin and saying, "God prosper him! By Allah, he is deserving. God's
      blessing on his days!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile <a href="#linknote-486" name="linknoteref-486"
      id="linknoteref-486"><small>486</small></a> Alaeddin, having made an end
      of the morning-meal, arose and taking leave of the Sultan, mounted with
      his mamelukes and rode to his palace, so he might prepare for the
      reception of his bride, the Lady Bedrulbudour. As he passed, all the folk
      cried out to him with one voice, saying, "God gladden thee! God increase
      thee in glory! God continue thee!" And so they brought him home in great
      procession, what while he showered gold on them. When he came to his
      palace, he alighted and entering, sat down in the Divan, whilst the
      mamelukes stood before him with clasped hands. After a little they brought
      him sherbets and he gave commandment to his mamelukes and slave-girls and
      eunuchs and all who were in his palace that they should make ready to
      receive the Lady Bedrulbudour, his bride. Then, when it was the time of
      the midafternoon prayer <a href="#linknote-487" name="linknoteref-487"
      id="linknoteref-487"><small>487</small></a> and the air grew cool and the
      heat of the sun abated, <a href="#linknote-488" name="linknoteref-488"
      id="linknoteref-488"><small>488</small></a> the Sultan bade the troops and
      the Amirs and the Viziers go down to the horse-course. So they all
      repaired thither and with them the Sultan himself; whereupon Alaeddin also
      arose and mounting with his mamelukes, went down into the plain and showed
      his horsemanship; then he fell to playing <a href="#linknote-489"
      name="linknoteref-489" id="linknoteref-489"><small>489</small></a> in the
      tilting-ground and there was none could stand before him. Now he was
      riding a stallion whose like is not among the horses of the Arabs of the
      Arabs <a href="#linknote-490" name="linknoteref-490" id="linknoteref-490"><small>490</small></a>
      and his bride the Lady Bedrulbudour was looking upon him from the window
      of her pavilion, and when she saw his grace and goodliness and knightly
      prowess, she was overcome with his love and was like to fly for joy in
      him. Then, after they had played [some] bouts <a href="#linknote-491"
      name="linknoteref-491" id="linknoteref-491"><small>491</small></a> in the
      plain and each had shown what was in him of horsemanship, (but Alaeddin
      overpassed them all,) the Sultan went to his palace and Alaeddin on like
      wise returned home.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was eventide, the chiefs of the state and the Viziers went and
      taking Alaeddin, carried him in procession to the Royal Bath, the
      Renowned; <a href="#linknote-492" name="linknoteref-492"
      id="linknoteref-492"><small>492</small></a> so he entered and bathed and
      perfumed himself, then, coming forth, he donned a suit yet richer than the
      first and mounted, whilst the troops rode before him and the Amirs and
      Viziers. So they fared on with him in great state, with four of the
      Viziers for his sword-bearers, whilst all the troops and people of the
      city, both townsfolk and strangers, walked in procession before him,
      carrying flambeaux and drums and flutes and instruments of mirth and
      music, till they brought him to his palace, when he alighted and entering,
      sat down, as did also the Viziers and Amirs who were in his company,
      whilst the mamelukes brought sherbets and sweetmeats <a
      href="#linknote-493" name="linknoteref-493" id="linknoteref-493"><small>493</small></a>
      and gave all who were with him in the procession to drink, albeit they
      were a multitude of folk whose number might not be told. Moreover, he gave
      commandment unto his mamelukes, and they went out to the door of the
      palace and fell to showering gold upon the folk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, <a href="#linknote-494" name="linknoteref-494"
      id="linknoteref-494"><small>494</small></a> when the Sultan returned from
      the horse-course and entered his palace, he bade forthright carry his
      daughter the Lady Bedrulbudour in procession to the palace of her
      bridegroom Alaeddin. So the troops forthright mounted with the officers of
      state, who had been in Alaeddin's procession, and the slave-girls and
      eunuchs went out with flambeaux and carried the Lady Bedrulhudour in great
      state to her bridegroom's palace, Alaeddin's mother by her side and before
      her the women of the Viziers and Amirs and grandees and notables.
      Moreover, she had with her eight and-forty slave-girls, whom Alaeddin had
      presented to her, in each one's hand a great candle of camphor and
      ambergris, set in a candlestick of gold, studded with jewels; and all the
      men and women in the palace went out with her and fared on before her,
      till they brought her to her bridegroom's palace and carrying her up to
      her pavilion, <a href="#linknote-495" name="linknoteref-495"
      id="linknoteref-495"><small>495</small></a> attired her in various robes
      <a href="#linknote-496" name="linknoteref-496" id="linknoteref-496"><small>496</small></a>
      and displayed her. Then, after they had made an end of displaying her,
      they carried her to the pavilion of her groom Alaeddin and he went in to
      her. Now his mother was with the Lady Bedrulbudour, and when he came up
      and did off her veil, she fell to gazing upon the bride's beauty and grace
      and looked at the pavilion, the which was all wroughten <a
      href="#linknote-497" name="linknoteref-497" id="linknoteref-497"><small>497</small></a>
      of gold and jewels and therein were golden lustres, all embossed with
      emeralds and rubies; and she said in herself, "Methought the Sultan's
      palace was magnificent; but, for this pavilion <a href="#linknote-498"
      name="linknoteref-498" id="linknoteref-498"><small>498</small></a> alone,
      I doubt me the greatest of the Chosroes and the kings never owned its
      match; nor, methinketh, might all mankind avail to make the like thereof."
      And the Lady Bedrulbudour also fell to looking and marvelling at the
      palace <a href="#linknote-499" name="linknoteref-499" id="linknoteref-499"><small>499</small></a>
      and its magnificence. Then the table was laid and they ate and drank and
      made merry; and presently there appeared before them fourscore
      slave-girls, each with an instrument in her hand of the instruments of
      mirth and music. So they plied their finger-tips and touching their
      strings, struck up with plaintive airs, till they clove in sunder the
      hearts of the listeners, whilst the Lady Bedrulbudour redoubled in
      wonderment and said in herself, "Never in my life heard I the like of
      these songs;" so that she forgot to eat and fell to listening. As for
      Alaeddin, he proceeded to pour to her the wine and give her to drink with
      his own hand, and mirth and good cheer and delight went round among them
      and it was a rare night, such as Iskender of the Horns <a
      href="#linknote-500" name="linknoteref-500" id="linknoteref-500"><small>500</small></a>
      never in his time spent. Then, after they had made an end of eating and
      drinking, the tables were removed from before them and Alaeddin arose and
      went in to his bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was the morning, Alaeddin arose and his treasurer brought him a
      costly suit of the richest of kings' raiment; so he donned it and sat
      down; whereupon coffee was brought him with ambergris and he drank thereof
      and called for the horses. Accordingly, they were saddled and he mounted
      and rode, with his mamelukes behind him and before him, to the Sultan's
      palace. When he reached it and entered, the eunuchs went in and acquainted
      the Sultan with his presence; which <a href="#linknote-501"
      name="linknoteref-501" id="linknoteref-501"><small>501</small></a> when he
      heard, he arose forthwith and coming to meet Alaeddin, embraced him and
      kissing him, as he were his son, seated him on his right hand. Moreover
      the Viziers and Amirs and officers of state and grandees of the realm
      invoked blessings on him and the Sultan gave him joy <a
      href="#linknote-502" name="linknoteref-502" id="linknoteref-502"><small>502</small></a>
      and prayed God prosper him. Then he bade lay breakfast; <a
      href="#linknote-503" name="linknoteref-503" id="linknoteref-503"><small>503</small></a>
      so they laid [it] and they all broke their fast; and after they had eaten
      and drunken their sufficiency and had finished and the servants had
      removed the tables from before them, Alaeddin turned to the Sultan and
      said to him, "O my lord, [belike] Thy Grace will vouchsafe to honour me
      this day at the morning-meal with the Lady Bedrulbudour, thy precious
      daughter, and be Thy Grace's company all thy viziers and the chief
      officers of thy state." Quoth the Sultan, (and indeed he rejoiced in him),
      "Gladly, <a href="#linknote-504" name="linknoteref-504"
      id="linknoteref-504"><small>504</small></a> O my son," and bidding the
      Viziers and officers of state and grandees attend him, arose forthright
      and mounted; whereupon Alaeddin and the others mounted also and they all
      rode till they came to Alaeddin's palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Sultan entered the palace and viewed its building and ordinance
      and saw its stones, which were of jade and agate, he was amazed <a
      href="#linknote-505" name="linknoteref-505" id="linknoteref-505"><small>505</small></a>
      and his wit was bewildered at that affluence and wealth and magnificence;
      so he turned to the Vizier and said to him, "How sayst thou, O Vizier?
      Hast thou in all thy days seen aught like this? Are there found with the
      greatest of the kings of the world riches and gold and jewels such as
      these we see in this palace?" "O my lord the King," answered the Vizier,
      "this is a thing beyond the competence of a king of the sons of Adam, nor
      might all the people of the earth together avail to build a palace like
      this; nay, there are no craftsmen living able to do work like this, except
      it be, as I said to Thy Grace, by might of magic." <a href="#linknote-506"
      name="linknoteref-506" id="linknoteref-506"><small>506</small></a> The
      Sultan knew that the Vizier, in seeking to convince him that this was not
      by might of men, but all of it enchantment, still spoke not but of his
      envy of Alaeddin; so he said to him, "Enough, O Vizier; let us have no
      more of thy talk. I know the cause which maketh thee speak on this wise."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Alaeddin forewent the Sultan till he brought him to the high pavilion
      <a href="#linknote-507" name="linknoteref-507" id="linknoteref-507"><small>507</small></a>
      and he looked at the belvedere <a href="#linknote-508"
      name="linknoteref-508" id="linknoteref-508"><small>508</small></a> and its
      oriols <a href="#linknote-509" name="linknoteref-509" id="linknoteref-509"><small>509</small></a>
      and lattices, <a href="#linknote-510" name="linknoteref-510"
      id="linknoteref-510"><small>510</small></a> all wroughten of emeralds and
      rubies and other precious stones, and was amazed and astonied; his wit was
      bewildered and he abode perplexed in his thought. Then he fell to going
      round about the pavilion and viewing these things that ravished the sight,
      till presently he espied the casement <a href="#linknote-511"
      name="linknoteref-511" id="linknoteref-511"><small>511</small></a> which
      Alaeddin had purposely left wanting and unfinished. When the Sultan
      examined it and saw that it was unfinished, he said, "Woe is me for thee,
      O casement, that thou art not perfect!" Then, turning to the Vizier, he
      said to him, "Knowest thou the reason of the lack of completion of this
      casement and its lattices?" "O <a href="#linknote-512"
      name="linknoteref-512" id="linknoteref-512"><small>512</small></a> my
      lord," answered the Vizier, "methinketh it is because Thy Grace hastened
      upon Alaeddin with the wedding and he had no time to complete it." Now
      Alaeddin had meanwhile gone in to his bride, the Lady Bedrulbudour, to
      acquaint her with the coming of her father the Sultan; and when he
      returned, the Sultan said to him, "O my son Alaeddin, what is the reason
      that the lattice[-work] of yonder oriel <a href="#linknote-513"
      name="linknoteref-513" id="linknoteref-513"><small>513</small></a> is not
      completed?" "O King of the Age," replied Alaeddin, "by reason of the haste
      made with the bridal, the craftsmen might not avail to <a
      href="#linknote-514" name="linknoteref-514" id="linknoteref-514"><small>514</small></a>
      finish it." Quoth the Sultan to him, "It is my wish to finish it myself."
      And Alaeddin answered, saying, "God prolong thy glory, O King; so shall
      there remain unto thee a remembrance <a href="#linknote-515"
      name="linknoteref-515" id="linknoteref-515"><small>515</small></a> in thy
      daughter's palace."
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly the Sultan bade straightway fetch jewellers and goldsmiths and
      commanded to give them from the treasury all that they needed of gold and
      jewels and [precious] metals; so they came and he bade them do that which
      was wanting of the lattice-work of the [unfinished] oriel. <a
      href="#linknote-516" name="linknoteref-516" id="linknoteref-516"><small>516</small></a>
      Meanwhile, the Lady Bedrulbudour came out to receive her father the
      Sultan, and when she came up to him and he saw her smiling-faced he
      embraced her and kissed her and taking her [by the hand], went in with her
      to her pavilion. So they entered all, for that it was the appointed time
      of the morning-meal and they had set one table for the Sultan and the Lady
      Bedrulbudour and Alaeddin and another for the Vizier and the officers of
      state and grandees of the realm and captains and chamberlains and
      deputies. The Sultan sat between his daughter, the Lady Bedrulbudour, and
      his son-in-law Alaeddin, and when he put his hand to the food and tasted
      it, wonder took him at the richness of the meats and the exquisiteness of
      their seasonings. <a href="#linknote-517" name="linknoteref-517"
      id="linknoteref-517"><small>517</small></a> Now there stood before them
      fourscore damsels, each as it were she said to the full moon, "Rise, so I
      may sit in thy place;" and in each one's hand was an instrument of mirth
      and music. So they tuned their instruments and touched their strings and
      struck up with plaintive <a href="#linknote-518" name="linknoteref-518"
      id="linknoteref-518"><small>518</small></a> airs that dilated the mourning
      heart. <a href="#linknote-519" name="linknoteref-519" id="linknoteref-519"><small>519</small></a>
      The Sultan was cheered and the time was pleasant to him and he rejoiced
      and said, "Verily, Kings and Kaisers would fail of <a href="#linknote-520"
      name="linknoteref-520" id="linknoteref-520"><small>520</small></a> this
      thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they fell to eating and drinking and the cup went round among them
      till they had taken their sufficiency, when there came sweetmeats <a
      href="#linknote-521" name="linknoteref-521" id="linknoteref-521"><small>521</small></a>
      and various kinds of fruits and so forth; and these were laid in another
      saloon. So they removed thither and took their fill of those dainties;
      after which the Sultan arose, that he might see if the work of the
      jewellers and goldsmiths likened that of the palace. So he went up to them
      and viewed their work and how they wrought and saw that they were far from
      availing to do work like that [of the rest] of Alaeddin's palace. <a
      href="#linknote-522" name="linknoteref-522" id="linknoteref-522"><small>522</small></a>
      Moreover <a href="#linknote-523" name="linknoteref-523"
      id="linknoteref-523"><small>523</small></a> they told him that all they
      found in his treasury they had brought and it sufficed not; whereupon he
      bade open the Great Treasury and give them what they needed and that, if
      it sufficed not, they should take that which Alaeddin had given him. So
      they took all the jewels assigned them by the Sultan and wrought with
      them, but found that these also sufficed them not, nor might they complete
      withal the half of that which lacked of the lattice work of the oriel; <a
      href="#linknote-524" name="linknoteref-524" id="linknoteref-524"><small>524</small></a>
      whereupon the Sultan bade take all the jewels which should be found with
      the Viziers and chiefs of the state; and accordingly they took them all
      and wrought therewith; but this also sufficed not.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was morning, Alaeddin went up to view the jewelers' work and saw
      that they had not completed half the lacking lattice-work; whereupon he
      bade them incontinent undo all that they had wrought and restore the
      jewels to their owners. Accordingly, they undid it all and sent to the
      Sultan that which was his and to the Viziers [and others] that which was
      theirs. Then they went to the Sultan and told him that Alaeddin had
      commanded them of this; whereupon he asked them, "What said he to you and
      why would he not have the lattice-work finished and why undid he that
      which you had done?" And they said to him, "O my lord, we know nothing,
      save that he bade us undo all that we had done." Whereupon the Sultan
      immediately called for the horses and arising, mounted and rode to
      Alaeddin's palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Alaeddin, after dismissing the goldsmiths and the jewellers,
      entered his closet and rubbed the lamp; whereupon the genie forthwith
      appeared and said to him, "Seek what thou wilt; thy slave is before thee."
      And Alaeddin said to him, "It is my will that thou complete the lacking
      lattice-work of the oriel." <a href="#linknote-525" name="linknoteref-525"
      id="linknoteref-525"><small>525</small></a> "On my head and eyes [be it],"
      replied the slave and disappearing, returned after a little and said to
      him, "O my lord, that whereof thou commandedst me I have performed." So
      Alaeddin went up to the belvedere <a href="#linknote-526"
      name="linknoteref-526" id="linknoteref-526"><small>526</small></a> and
      found all its lattices <a href="#linknote-527" name="linknoteref-527"
      id="linknoteref-527"><small>527</small></a> perfect; and whilst he was
      viewing them, behold the [chief] eunuch <a href="#linknote-528"
      name="linknoteref-528" id="linknoteref-528"><small>528</small></a> came in
      to him and said to him, "O my lord, the Sultan cometh to visit thee and is
      at the palace-door." So he came down forthright and went to meet the
      Sultan, who <a href="#linknote-529" name="linknoteref-529"
      id="linknoteref-529"><small>529</small></a> said to him, when he saw him,
      "Wherefore, O my son, hast thou done thus, and why sufferedst thou not the
      jewellers complete the lattice-work of the oriel, <a href="#linknote-530"
      name="linknoteref-530" id="linknoteref-530"><small>530</small></a> so
      there might not remain a place in thy palace <a href="#linknote-531"
      name="linknoteref-531" id="linknoteref-531"><small>531</small></a>
      defective?" "O King of the Age," answered Alaeddin, "I left it not
      imperfect but of my free will, nor did I lack of ableness to complete it.
      However, I could not brook that Thy Grace should honour me [with thy
      presence] in a palace <a href="#linknote-532" name="linknoteref-532"
      id="linknoteref-532"><small>532</small></a> wherein there was somewhat
      lacking; wherefore, so thou mayst know that it was not for lack of
      ableness that I left it uncomplete, <a href="#linknote-533"
      name="linknoteref-533" id="linknoteref-533"><small>533</small></a> let Thy
      Grace go up and see the lattice-work of the kiosk, <a href="#linknote-534"
      name="linknoteref-534" id="linknoteref-534"><small>534</small></a> an
      there be aught lacking thereto."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sultan accordingly went up to the pavilion <a href="#linknote-535"
      name="linknoteref-535" id="linknoteref-535"><small>535</small></a> and
      entering the kiosk, <a href="#linknote-536" name="linknoteref-536"
      id="linknoteref-536"><small>536</small></a> viewed it right and left and
      saw no manner defect in its lattices, but found them all perfect; whereat
      he was astounded and embracing Alaeddin, fell a-kissing him and saying, "O
      my son, what is this extraordinary thing? In one night thou dost a work
      wherefrom the jewellers would fail in months! By Allah, methinketh thou
      hast not thy fellow <a href="#linknote-537" name="linknoteref-537"
      id="linknoteref-537"><small>537</small></a> in the world!" Quoth Alaeddin,
      "God prolong thy life and perpetuate thy continuance! Thy slave is not
      worthy of this praise." "By Allah, O my son," rejoined the Sultan, "thou
      deservest all praise, in that thou hast done a thing wherefrom [all the]
      craftsmen of the world would fail." Then he went down and entering the
      pavilion of his daughter, the Lady Bedrulbudour, found her rejoicing
      exceedingly over this great magnificence wherein she was; and after he had
      rested with her awhile, he returned to his palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Alaeddin used every day to mount and ride through the town, with his
      mamelukes behind him and before him, strewing gold upon the people, right
      and left, and the folk, stranger and neighbour, near and far, were
      fulfilled with the love of him for the excess of his munificence and his
      bounty. Moreover he exceeded in benefaction of the poor and the indigent
      <a href="#linknote-538" name="linknoteref-538" id="linknoteref-538"><small>538</small></a>
      and used himself to distribute his alms to them with his own hand. After
      this fashion he won himself great renown in all the realm and the most of
      the chiefs of the state and the Amirs used to eat at his table and swore
      not but by his precious life. Moreover, he fell to going everywhile <a
      href="#linknote-539" name="linknoteref-539" id="linknoteref-539"><small>539</small></a>
      to the chase and the horse course and to practicing horsemanship and
      archery <a href="#linknote-540" name="linknoteref-540" id="linknoteref-540"><small>540</small></a>
      before the Sultan, whilst the Lady Bedrulbudour redoubled in love of him,
      whenassoever she saw him disporting himself a horseback, and thought in
      herself that God had wrought exceeding graciously by her in that there had
      befallen her what befell with the Vizier's son, so He might keep her for
      her true bridegroom Alaeddin. So <a href="#linknote-541"
      name="linknoteref-541" id="linknoteref-541"><small>541</small></a> he went
      daily waxing in goodliness of repute and in praise and the love of him
      redoubled in the hearts of the common folk and he was magnified in men's
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now in those days certain of the Sultan's enemies took horse against him;
      so he levied troops to repel them and made Alaeddin chief thereof.
      Alaeddin set out with his host and fared on till he drew near the enemy,
      whose troops were exceeding many; where upon he drew his sword and fell
      upon them and there befell battle and slaughter and sore was the stress of
      the mellay; but Alaeddin broke them and routed them and slew the most part
      of them. Moreover, he plundered their goods and possessions and gat him
      spoil beyond count or reckoning, wherewith he returned in triumph, [having
      gained] a great victory, and entered the city, which had adorned itself
      for him of its joy in him. The Sultan came out to meet him and give him
      joy and embraced him and kissed him, and there was high festival holden in
      the kingdom and great rejoicing. Then the Sultan and Alaeddin betook
      themselves to the latter's palace; <a href="#linknote-542"
      name="linknoteref-542" id="linknoteref-542"><small>542</small></a>
      whereupon his bride, the Lady Bedrulbudour, came out to meet him,
      rejoicing in him, and kissed him between the eyes, and he went in with her
      to her pavilion; <a href="#linknote-543" name="linknoteref-543"
      id="linknoteref-543"><small>543</small></a> whither after a little came
      the Sultan and they sat down and the slave-girls brought sherbets. <a
      href="#linknote-544" name="linknoteref-544" id="linknoteref-544"><small>544</small></a>
      So they drank and the Sultan commanded that all the realm should be
      decorated for Alaeddin's victory over the enemy; whilst it became [a
      saying] with the commons and the troops and the folk, all of them, "Allah
      in heaven and Alaeddin on earth." and they loved him yet more, having
      regard not only to the excess of his bounty and munificence, but to his
      knightly prowess, in that he had done battle for the kingdom and had
      routed the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for Alaeddin, and now to return to the Mangrabin enchanter. When
      he returned to his country, he abode all this time, bewailing that which
      he had endured of toil and stress, so he might compass the lamp, yet had
      his travail all been wasted and the morsel had escaped from his hand,
      after it had reached his mouth; and he still thought upon all this,
      bemoaning himself and reviling Alaeddin of the excess of his anger against
      him; and whiles he said in himself, "Since yonder whoreson is dead under
      the earth, I am content withal and I have hopes of the lamp, that I may
      yet achieve it, inasmuch as it is still safeguarded." Then, one day of the
      days, he smote the sand and extracting the figures, set them down after
      the most approved fashion <a href="#linknote-545" name="linknoteref-545"
      id="linknoteref-545"><small>545</small></a> and adjusted <a
      href="#linknote-546" name="linknoteref-546" id="linknoteref-546"><small>546</small></a>
      them, so he might see and certify himself of the death of Alaeddin and the
      safe keeping of the lamp under the earth; and he looked well into <a
      href="#linknote-547" name="linknoteref-547" id="linknoteref-547"><small>547</small></a>
      the figures, both mothers and daughters, <a href="#linknote-548"
      name="linknoteref-548" id="linknoteref-548"><small>548</small></a> but saw
      not the lamp, whereupon rage overrode him and he smote the sand a second
      time, that he might certify himself of Alaeddin's death, but saw him not
      in the treasure; whereat he redoubled in wrath, and yet more when it was
      certified to him that the lad was alive upon the surface of the earth and
      he knew that he had come forth from under the ground and had gotten the
      lamp, on account whereof he himself had suffered toil and torment such as
      passeth man's power to endure. So he said in himself, "I have suffered
      many hardships for the sake of the lamp and have endured fatigues such as
      none but I might brook, <a href="#linknote-549" name="linknoteref-549"
      id="linknoteref-549"><small>549</small></a> and now yonder accursed one
      taketh it without stress and it is evident <a href="#linknote-550"
      name="linknoteref-550" id="linknoteref-550"><small>550</small></a> [that],
      an he have learned the use thereof, there will be none in the world richer
      than he."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, <a href="#linknote-551" name="linknoteref-551" id="linknoteref-551"><small>551</small></a>
      when he saw and was certified that Alaeddin had come forth from under the
      earth and had happened upon the good of the Lamp, <a href="#linknote-552"
      name="linknoteref-552" id="linknoteref-552"><small>552</small></a> he said
      in himself, "Needs must I go about to kill him." So he smote the sand once
      more and examining its figures, saw that Alaeddin had gotten him exceeding
      wealth and had married the Sultan's daughter; whereat he was all afire for
      rage and envy and arising then and there, equipped himself for travel and
      set out for the land of China. When he came to the city of the sultanate,
      <a href="#linknote-553" name="linknoteref-553" id="linknoteref-553"><small>553</small></a>
      wherein was Alaeddin, he entered and alighting at one of the khans, heard
      the folk talking of nought but the magnificence of Alaeddin's palace;
      then, after he was rested from his journey, he changed <a
      href="#linknote-554" name="linknoteref-554" id="linknoteref-554"><small>554</small></a>
      his clothes and went down to go round about in the thoroughfares of the
      city. He passed no folk but they were descanting upon the palace and its
      magnificence and talking of Alaeddin's grace and comeliness and his bounty
      and munificence and the goodliness of his manners and disposition; so <a
      href="#linknote-555" name="linknoteref-555" id="linknoteref-555"><small>555</small></a>
      he went up to one of those who were extolling Alaeddin on this wise and
      said to him, "Prithee, fair youth, who is this whom you describe and
      praise?" "O man," replied the other, "meseemeth thou art a stranger and
      comest from afar; but, granting thou art from a far country, hast thou not
      heard of the Amir Alaeddin, whose repute, methought, filled the earth, and
      of his palace, a wonder of the world, whereof both far and near have
      heard? How is it thou hast heard nought of this nor of the name of
      Alaeddin, whom Our Lord increase in glory and prosper?" Quoth the
      Maugrabin, "Marry, it is the utmost of my wish to look upon the palace;
      so, an thou wouldst do me a kindness, direct me thither, for that I am a
      stranger." "Hearkening and obedience," replied the other and going before
      him, guided him to Alaeddin's palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Maugrabin fell to examining it and knew that this all of it was the
      work of the Lamp; so he said, "Alack! Alack! Needs must I dig a pit for
      this accursed one, this tailor's son, who could not come by a night's
      supper; but, an destiny enable me, I will send his mother back to spin at
      her wheel, like as she did erst, and as for him, it shall cost him <a
      href="#linknote-556" name="linknoteref-556" id="linknoteref-556"><small>556</small></a>
      his life." Then he returned to the khan in a woeful state of chagrin and
      colour and despite, for envy of Alaeddin, and <a href="#linknote-557"
      name="linknoteref-557" id="linknoteref-557"><small>557</small></a> taking
      his geomantic instruments, <a href="#linknote-558" name="linknoteref-558"
      id="linknoteref-558"><small>558</small></a> smote his [tablet of] sand, so
      he might learn where the lamp was, and found that it was in the palace and
      not with Alaeddin; <a href="#linknote-559" name="linknoteref-559"
      id="linknoteref-559"><small>559</small></a> whereat he rejoiced with an
      exceeding joy and said, "Now it will be an easy matter for me to bereave
      this accursed of his life and I have a way to come at the lamp."
      Accordingly he went to a coppersmith and said to him, "Make me so many <a
      href="#linknote-560" name="linknoteref-560" id="linknoteref-560"><small>560</small></a>
      lamps <a href="#linknote-561" name="linknoteref-561" id="linknoteref-561"><small>561</small></a>
      and take of me their worth in full; <a href="#linknote-562"
      name="linknoteref-562" id="linknoteref-562"><small>562</small></a> but I
      will have thee despatch them quickly." "Hearkening and obedience," replied
      the smith and falling to work on them, speedily despatched them for him.
      When they were finished, the Maugrabin paid him their price, even that
      which he sought, and taking the lamps, carried them to the khan, where he
      laid them in a basket and fell to going round about in the markets and
      thoroughfares of the city and crying out, "Ho! who will barter an old lamp
      for a new lamp?" When the folk heard him crying this, they laughed at him
      and said, "Certes, this man is mad, since he goeth about, bartering new
      lamps for old." Moreover, people <a href="#linknote-563"
      name="linknoteref-563" id="linknoteref-563"><small>563</small></a>
      followed him and the street-boys caught him up from place to place <a
      href="#linknote-564" name="linknoteref-564" id="linknoteref-564"><small>564</small></a>
      and laughed at him. However, he fended not himself neither took heed of
      this, but ceased not to go round about the city till he came under
      Alaeddin's palace, where he fell to crying his loudest, whilst the
      children called after him, "Madman! Madman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Now as fate willed it, the Lady Bedrulbudour was in the kiosk and hearing
      one crying out and the boys calling after him and understanding not what
      was toward, bade one of the slave-girls "Go see what is this man who
      crieth out and what he crieth." So the girl went and looking, saw one
      crying out, "Ho, who will barter an old lamp for a new lamp?" with the
      boys after him, laughing at him; so she returned and told her mistress,
      saying, "O my lady, this man crieth, 'Ho! who will barter an old lamp for
      a new lamp?' and the boys are following him and laughing at him;" and the
      Lady Bedrulbudour laughed also at this marvel. Now Alaeddin had forgotten
      the lamp in his pavilion, <a href="#linknote-565" name="linknoteref-565"
      id="linknoteref-565"><small>565</small></a> without locking it up in his
      treasury [as was his wont], and one of the girls had seen it; so she said
      to the princess, "O my lady, methinketh I have seen an old lamp in my lord
      Alaeddin's pavilion; let us barter it with this man for a new one, so we
      may see an his speech be true or leasing." And <a href="#linknote-566"
      name="linknoteref-566" id="linknoteref-566"><small>566</small></a> the
      princess said to her, "fetch the lamp whereof thou speakest." Now the Lady
      Bedrulbudour had no knowledge of the lamp and its properties, neither knew
      she that this it was which had brought Alaeddin her husband to that great
      estate, and it was the utmost of her desire to prove and see the wit of
      this man who bartered new for old, nor was any one aware of the Maugrabin
      enchanter's craft and trickery. So the slave-girl went up into Alaeddin's
      pavilion and returned with the lamp to the Lady Bedrulbudour, who bade the
      Aga of the eunuchs <a href="#linknote-567" name="linknoteref-567"
      id="linknoteref-567"><small>567</small></a> go down and exchange it for a
      new one; so he took it and going down, gave it to the Maugrabin and took
      of him a new lamp, with which he returned to the princess, who examined it
      and finding it new and real, fell to laughing at the Maugrabin's [lack of]
      wit. Meanwhile, when the enchanter had gotten the lamp and knew it for
      that of the Treasure, he thrust it forthwith into his sleeve <a
      href="#linknote-568" name="linknoteref-568" id="linknoteref-568"><small>568</small></a>
      and leaving the rest of the lamps to the folk who were in act to barter of
      him, set off running, till he came without the city, and walked about the
      waste places, awaiting the coming of the night. Then, when he saw himself
      alone in the open country, he brought out the lamp from his sleeve and
      rubbed it; whereupon the Marid immediately appeared to him and said, "Here
      am I; thy slave [is] before thee. Seek of me what thou wilt." Quoth the
      Maugrabin, "My will is that thou take up Alaeddin's palace from its place,
      with its inhabitants and all that <a href="#linknote-569"
      name="linknoteref-569" id="linknoteref-569"><small>569</small></a> is
      therein and myself also, and set it down in my country of Africa. <a
      href="#linknote-570" name="linknoteref-570" id="linknoteref-570"><small>570</small></a>
      Thou knowest my town and I will have this palace be thereby among the
      gardens." "Hearkening and obedience," replied the Marid. "Shut [thine] eye
      and open [thine] eye, and thou wilt find thyself in thine own country with
      the palace." And immediately this befell in the twinkling of an eye and
      the Maugrabin was transported, with Alaeddin's palace and all that was
      therein, to the land of Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for the enchanter, and now let us return to the Sultan and
      Alaeddin. The Sultan, of his love and affection for his daughter the Lady
      Bedrulbudour, was wont, every day, when he awoke from his sleep, to open
      the window and look at her therefrom; so he arose on the morrow, according
      to his wont, and opened his chamber-window, so he might see his daughter;
      but <a href="#linknote-571" name="linknoteref-571" id="linknoteref-571"><small>571</small></a>
      when he put out his head and looked for Alaeddin's palace, he beheld
      nothing but a place swept [and level], like as it was aforetime, and saw
      neither palace nor inhabitants; <a href="#linknote-572"
      name="linknoteref-572" id="linknoteref-572"><small>572</small></a> whereat
      amazement clad him and his wit was bewildered and he fell to rubbing his
      eyes, so haply they were bleared or dimmed. Then he proceeded to look
      closely till at last he was certified that there was neither trace nor
      sign left of the palace and knew not what was come of it; whereupon he
      redoubled in perplexity and smote hand upon hand and his tears ran down
      upon his beard, for that he knew not what had befallen his daughter. So he
      sent forthright to fetch the Vizier, who came in to him and seeing him in
      that woeful state, said to him, "Pardon, O King of the Age (God keep thee
      from harm!) why art thou woeful?" Quoth the Sultan, "Meseemeth thou
      knowest not of my affair." And the Vizier said to him, "By Allah, O my
      lord, I have no knowledge of aught whatsoever." "Then," rejoined the
      Sultan, "thou hast not looked towards Alaeddin's palace." "Nay, O my
      lord," replied the Vizier, "it is yet shut." And the Sultan said to him,
      "Since thou hast no news of aught, rise and look at it from the window and
      see where it is, this palace of Alaeddin's, whereof thou sayest that it is
      yet shut." The Vizier arose and looked from the window towards Alaeddin's
      palace, but could see nothing, neither palace nor aught else; so his wit
      was bewildered and he was amazed and returned to the Sultan, who said to
      him, "Now knowest thou the cause of my distress and seest Alaeddin his
      palace, whereof thou saddest that it was shut." "O King of the Age,"
      rejoined the Vizier, "I told Thy Grace aforetime that this palace and
      these affairs were all of them [the work of] enchantment."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the Sultan was fired with wrath and said to him, "Where is
      Alaeddin?" And he answered, "He is at the chase." Whereupon the Sultan
      bade sundry of his eunuchs and officers go straightway fetch him bound and
      shackled. So they went till they came to Alaeddin and said to him, "O our
      lord Alaeddin, blame us not, for that the Sultan hath bidden us carry thee
      to him, bound and shackled; wherefore we beseech thee of excusement, for
      that we are under a royal commandment and may not gainsay it." When
      Alaeddin heard their speech, wonderment took him and his tongue was tied,
      for that he knew not the cause; then he turned to the eunuchs and officers
      and said, "Prithee, sirs, <a href="#linknote-573" name="linknoteref-573"
      id="linknoteref-573"><small>573</small></a> have you no knowledge of the
      cause of this commandment of the Sultan? I know myself guiltless,
      forasmuch as I have done no sin against the Sultan nor against his realm."
      And they said to him, "O our lord, we have no manner of knowledge
      thereof." So Alaeddin lighted down from his stallion and said to them, "Do
      with me that which the Sultan biddeth you, for that his commandment is
      upon the head and eyes." Accordingly <a href="#linknote-574"
      name="linknoteref-574" id="linknoteref-574"><small>574</small></a> the
      officers shackled him and pinioning him, haled him along in irons and
      entered the city with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The folk, seeing Alaeddin pinioned and shackled with iron, knew that the
      Sultan was minded to cut off his head, and forasmuch as he was
      extraordinarily beloved of them, they all gathered together and taking up
      arms, came forth their houses and followed the troops, so they might see
      what was to do. When the officers came with Alaeddin to the palace, they
      entered and told the Sultan, who immediately bade the headsman go and cut
      off his head. But the commons, hearing of this his commandment, shut the
      gates of the palace and sent to say to the Sultan, "This very moment we
      will overthrow the palace upon thee and all who are therein, an the least
      harm happen to Alaeddin." So the Vizier went and told the Sultan and said
      to him, "O King of the Age, all will be over with us forthright; <a
      href="#linknote-575" name="linknoteref-575" id="linknoteref-575"><small>575</small></a>
      wherefore thou wert best pardon Alaeddin, lest some calamity befall us,
      for that the commons love him more than us." Now the headsman had spread
      the carpet of blood and seating Alaeddin thereon, had bound his eyes and
      gone round him three times, <a href="#linknote-576" name="linknoteref-576"
      id="linknoteref-576"><small>576</small></a> awaiting the King's final
      commandment. The Sultan looked at his subjects and seeing them swarming
      upon him and climbing up to the palace, that they might overthrow it,
      commanded the headsman to hold his hand from Alaeddin and bade the crier
      go forth among the people and proclaim that he pardoned Alaeddin and took
      him [again] into favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Alaeddin found himself released and saw the Sultan sitting, he went
      up to him and said to him, "O my lord, since Thy Grace hath bountifully
      vouchsafed me my life, <a href="#linknote-577" name="linknoteref-577"
      id="linknoteref-577"><small>577</small></a> favour me [yet farther] and
      tell me the manner of my offence." "O traitor," replied the Sultan, "till
      [but] now I knew not thine offence;" then, turning to the Vizier, he said
      to him, "Take him, that he may see from the windows where his palace is."
      Accordingly the Vizier took him and Alaeddin looked from the windows in
      the direction of his palace and finding the place swept and clear, like as
      it was before he built the palace thereon, neither seeing any trace of the
      latter, he was amazed and bewildered, unknowing what had happened. When he
      returned, the King said to him, "What hast thou seen? Where is thy palace
      and where is my daughter, my heart's darling and mine only one, than whom
      I have none other?" And Alaeddin answered him, saying, "O King of the Age,
      I have no knowledge thereof, neither know I what hath befallen." And the
      Sultan said to him, "Know, O Alaeddin, that I have pardoned thee, so thou
      mayst go and look into this affair and make me search for my daughter; and
      do not thou present thyself but with her; nay, an thou bring her not back
      to me, as my head liveth, I will cut off thine." "Hearkening and
      obedience, O King of the Age," replied Alaeddin. "Grant me but forty days'
      grace, and an I bring her not after that time, cut off my head and do what
      thou wilt." Quoth <a href="#linknote-578" name="linknoteref-578"
      id="linknoteref-578"><small>578</small></a> the Sultan to him, "I grant
      thee, according to thy request, the space of forty days; but think not to
      flee from my hand, for that I will fetch thee back, though thou wert above
      the clouds, not to say upon the face of the earth." "O my lord the
      Sultan," rejoined Alaeddin, "as I said to Thy Grace, an I bring her not to
      thee in this space of time, I will present myself before thee, that thou
      mayst cut off my head."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the commons and the folk, one and all, when they saw Alaeddin,
      rejoiced in him with an exceeding joy and were glad for his deliverance;
      but the ignominy which had befallen him and shame and the exultation of
      the envious had bowed down his head; so he went forth and fell to going
      round about the city, perplexed anent his case and unknowing how all this
      had happened. He abode in the city two days in the woefullest of case,
      knowing not how he should do to find his palace and the Lady Bedrulbudour,
      his bride, what while certain of the folk used to come to him privily with
      meat and drink. Then he went forth, wandering in the deserts and knowing
      not whitherward he should aim, and ceased not going till he came to a
      river; whereupon, his hope being cut off for stress of chagrin that
      possessed him, he thought to cast himself into the stream; but, for that
      he was a pious Muslim, professing the unity of God, he feared God in
      himself and stood on the bank; of the stream to perform the ablution. <a
      href="#linknote-579" name="linknoteref-579" id="linknoteref-579"><small>579</small></a>
      So he took of the water in his hands and proceeded to rub between his
      fingers; and in doing this, his rubbing chanced upon the ring, whereupon a
      Marid appeared to him and said to him, "Here am I; thy slave is before
      thee. Seek what thou wilt."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Alaeddin saw the Marid, he rejoiced with an exceeding joy and said to
      him, "O slave, I will have thee bring me my palace, with my bride, the
      Lady Bedrulbudour, and all that is therein." "O my lord," replied the
      Marid, "it irketh me sore that what thou seekest of me is a thing unto
      which I cannot avail, for that it pertaineth unto the slaves of the Lamp
      and I may not adventure upon it." "Then," said Alaeddin, "since this is
      not possible unto thee, take me and set me down beside my palace, in what
      land soever it is." "Hearkening and obedience, O my lord," replied the
      Marid and taking him up, set him down, in the twinkling of an eye, beside
      his palace in the land of Africa and before his wife's pavilion. By this
      time, the night was come; so he looked at his palace and his cares and
      sorrows were dispelled from him and he trusted in God, after he had
      forsworn hope, that he should see his bride once again. Then he fell to
      thinking upon the hidden mercies of God (glorified be His might!) and how
      He had vouchsafed <a href="#linknote-580" name="linknoteref-580"
      id="linknoteref-580"><small>580</small></a> him the ring and how his hope
      had been cut off, except God had provided him with the slave of the Ring.
      So he rejoiced and all chagrin ceased from him; then, for that he had been
      four days without sleeping, of the stress of his chagrin and his trouble
      and his grief and the excess of his melancholy, he went to the side of the
      palace and lay down under a tree; for that, as I have said, the palace was
      among the gardens of Africa without the city. <a href="#linknote-581"
      name="linknoteref-581" id="linknoteref-581"><small>581</small></a> He <a
      href="#linknote-582" name="linknoteref-582" id="linknoteref-582"><small>582</small></a>
      lay that night under the tree in all ease; but he whose head is in the
      headsman's hand sleepeth not anights. <a href="#linknote-583"
      name="linknoteref-583" id="linknoteref-583"><small>583</small></a>
      However, fatigue and lack of sleep for four days past caused slumber get
      the mastery over him; <a href="#linknote-584" name="linknoteref-584"
      id="linknoteref-584"><small>584</small></a> so he slept till break of
      morn, when he awoke at the chirp <a href="#linknote-585"
      name="linknoteref-585" id="linknoteref-585"><small>585</small></a> of the
      sparrows. He arose and going to a stream there which flowed into the city,
      washed his hands and face; then, making the ablution, he prayed the
      morning-prayer and after returned and sat under the windows of the Lady
      Bedrulbudour's pavilion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the princess, of the excess of her grief for her separation from her
      husband and the Sultan her father and of her sore distress at that which
      had betided her with the accursed Maugrabin enchanter, used every day to
      arise, at the first peep of dawn, <a href="#linknote-586"
      name="linknoteref-586" id="linknoteref-586"><small>586</small></a> and sit
      weeping; nay, she slept not anights and forswore meat and drink. Her
      handmaid used to go in to her at the time of the Salutation, <a
      href="#linknote-587" name="linknoteref-587" id="linknoteref-587"><small>587</small></a>
      so she might dress her, and that morning, by the decree of destiny, the
      damsel opened the window at that time, thinking to solace her mistress
      with the sight of the trees and streams. So she looked out and seeing her
      lord Alaeddin sitting under the windows of the pavilion, said to the
      princess, "O my lady, my lady, here is my lord Alaeddin sitting under the
      pavilion!" Whereupon the Lady Bedrulbudour arose in haste and looking from
      the window, saw Alaeddin, and he raised his head and saw her; so she
      saluted him and he her and they were both like to fly for joy. Then said
      she to him, "Arise and come in to me by the privy door, for that the
      accursed one <a href="#linknote-588" name="linknoteref-588"
      id="linknoteref-588"><small>588</small></a> is not now here;" and she bade
      her handmaid go down and open the door. So the damsel went down and opened
      to Alaeddin, who arose and entered thereby. His wife, <a
      href="#linknote-589" name="linknoteref-589" id="linknoteref-589"><small>589</small></a>
      the Lady Bedrulbudour, met him at the door and they embraced and kissed
      each other with all joyance, till they fell a-weeping of the excess of
      their gladness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they sat down and Alaeddin said to her, "O Lady Bedrulbudour, there
      is somewhat whereof I would ask thee, before all things. I used to lay an
      old copper lamp in such a place in my pavilion..." When the princess heard
      this, she sighed and answered him, saying, "O my beloved, it was that
      which was the cause of our falling into this calamity." <a
      href="#linknote-590" name="linknoteref-590" id="linknoteref-590"><small>590</small></a>
      Quoth he, "How came this about?" So she acquainted him with the whole
      matter from first to last, telling him how they had bartered the old lamp
      for a new one; "and next morning," added she, "we found ourselves in this
      country and he who had cozened me and changed the lamp told me that he had
      wroughten these tricks upon us of the might of his magic, by means of the
      lamp and that he is a Maugrabin from Africa <a href="#linknote-591"
      name="linknoteref-591" id="linknoteref-591"><small>591</small></a> and
      that we are now in his native land." When <a href="#linknote-592"
      name="linknoteref-592" id="linknoteref-592"><small>592</small></a> she had
      made an end of her story, Alaeddin said to her, "Tell me, what does this
      accursed one purpose with thee; what saith he to thee and of what doth he
      bespeak thee and what is his will of thee?" "Every day," answered the
      princess, "he cometh to me once and no more and seeketh to draw me to his
      love, willing me take him in thy stead and forget and renounce thee; nay,
      he told me that my father the Sultan had cut off thy head. Moreover, he
      useth to say to me of thee that thou art the son of poor folk and that he
      was the cause of thine enrichment and seeketh to cajole me with talk, but
      never hath he seen of me aught but tears and weeping or heard from me one
      soft word." <a href="#linknote-593" name="linknoteref-593"
      id="linknoteref-593"><small>593</small></a> Quoth Alaeddin, "Tell me where
      he layeth the lamp, an thou knowest." And she said, "He still carrieth it
      [about him] nor will part with it a moment; nay, when he acquainted me
      with that whereof I have told thee, he brought out the lamp from his
      sleeve and showed it to me"
    </p>
    <p>
      When Alaeddin heard this, he rejoiced with an exceeding joy and said to
      her, "Harkye, Lady Bedrulbudour; it is my present intent to go out and
      return in disguise. <a href="#linknote-594" name="linknoteref-594"
      id="linknoteref-594"><small>594</small></a> Marvel thou not at this and
      let one of thy slave-girls abide await at the privy door, to open to me
      forthright, when she seeth me coming; and I will cast about for a device
      whereby I may slay this accursed one." Then he rose and going forth the
      [privy] door of his palace, walked on till he encountered a peasant by the
      way and said to him, "Harkye, sirrah, take my clothes and give me thine."
      The man demurred, but Alaeddin enforced him and taking his clothes from
      him, donned them and gave him his own costly apparel. Then he fared on in
      the high road till he came to the city and entering, betook himself to the
      drug-market, where for two diners he bought of [one of] the druggists two
      drachms of rare strong henbane, the son of its minute, <a
      href="#linknote-595" name="linknoteref-595" id="linknoteref-595"><small>595</small></a>
      and retracing his steps, returned to the palace. When the damsel saw him,
      she opened him the privy door and he went in to the Lady Bedrulbudour <a
      href="#linknote-596" name="linknoteref-596" id="linknoteref-596"><small>596</small></a>
      and said to her, "Harkye, I will have thee dress and tire thyself and put
      away melancholy from thee; and when the accursed Maugrabin cometh to thee,
      do thou receive him with 'Welcome and fair welcome' and go to meet him
      with a smiling face and bid him come sup with thee and profess to him that
      thou hast forgotten thy beloved Alaeddin and thy father and that thou
      lovest him with an exceeding love. Moreover, do thou seek of him wine, and
      that red, <a href="#linknote-597" name="linknoteref-597"
      id="linknoteref-597"><small>597</small></a> and make him a show of all joy
      and gladness and drink to his health. <a href="#linknote-598"
      name="linknoteref-598" id="linknoteref-598"><small>598</small></a> Then,
      when thou hast filled him two or three cups of wine, <a
      href="#linknote-599" name="linknoteref-599" id="linknoteref-599"><small>599</small></a>
      [watch] till thou take him off his guard; then put him this powder <a
      href="#linknote-600" name="linknoteref-600" id="linknoteref-600"><small>600</small></a>
      in the cup and fill it up with wine, and an he drink it, he will
      straightway turn over on his back, like a dead man." When the Lady
      Bedrulbudour heard Alaeddin's words, she said! to him, "This is a thing
      exceeding hard on me to do; but it is lawful to slay this accursed, so we
      may be delivered from his uncleanness who hath made me rue thy separation
      and that of my father." Then Alaeddin ate and drank with his wife that
      which stayed his hunger and rising at once, went forth the palace;
      whereupon the Lady Bedrulbudour summoned her tirewoman, who busked her and
      adorned her, and she rose and donned fine clothes and perfumed herself.
      Whilst she was thus engaged, the accursed Maugrabin presented himself and
      was exceeding rejoiced to see her on this wise, more by token that she
      received him with a smiling face, contrary to her wont; so he redoubled in
      distraction for her love and longing for her. Then she took him and
      seating him by her side, said to him, "O my beloved, an thou wilt, come
      hither to me this night and we will sup together. Enough of mourning; for
      that, an I sat grieving a thousand years, what were the profit? Alaeddin
      cannot return from the tomb and I have considered and believe <a
      href="#linknote-601" name="linknoteref-601" id="linknoteref-601"><small>601</small></a>
      that which thou saidst to me yesterday, to wit, that most like my father
      the Sultan hath slain him, in the excess of his grief for my loss. Nay,
      marvel not at me to-day, that I am changed since yesterday, for that I
      have bethought me to take thee to beloved and companion in Alaeddin's
      stead, seeing there is left me no man other than thou. Wherefore it is my
      hope that thou wilt come to-night, so we may sup together and drink
      somewhat of wine with each other, and I will have thee let me taste of the
      wine of thy country Africa, for that belike it is better [than ours].
      Wine, indeed, I have by me; but it is that of our country, and I desire
      exceedingly to taste the wine of your country."
    </p>
    <p>
      When <a href="#linknote-602" name="linknoteref-602" id="linknoteref-602"><small>602</small></a>
      the Maugrabin saw the love which the Lady Bedrulbudour professed to him
      and that she was changed from her whilom plight of grief, he thought that
      she had given up her hope of Alaeddin; so he rejoiced greatly and said to
      her, "O my soul, hearkening and obedience unto all that which thou wiliest
      and biddest me withal. I have with me in my house a jar of the wine of our
      country, the which I have kept stored these eight years under the earth;
      so I go now to fill from it our sufficiency and will return to thee
      forthright." Therewithal the Lady Bedrulbudour, that she might beguile him
      more and more, said to him, "O my beloved, do not thou go thyself and
      leave me. Send one of thy servants to fill us from the jar and abide thou
      sitting with me, that I may take comfort in thee." "O my lady," answered
      he, "none knoweth the place of the jar save myself; but I will not keep
      thee waiting." <a href="#linknote-603" name="linknoteref-603"
      id="linknoteref-603"><small>603</small></a> So saying, he went out and
      returned after a little with their sufficiency of wine; and the Lady
      Bedrulbudour said to him, "Thou hast been at pains <a href="#linknote-604"
      name="linknoteref-604" id="linknoteref-604"><small>604</small></a> [for
      me], and I have put thee to unease, <a href="#linknote-605"
      name="linknoteref-605" id="linknoteref-605"><small>605</small></a> O my
      beloved." "Nay," answered he, "O [thou that art dear to me as] mine eyes,
      I am honoured by thy service." Then she sat down with him at table and
      they both fell to eating. Presently, the princess called for drink and the
      handmaid immediately filled her the cup; then she filled for the Maugrabin
      and the Lady Bedrulbudour proceeded to drink to his life and health, <a
      href="#linknote-606" name="linknoteref-606" id="linknoteref-606"><small>606</small></a>
      and he also drank to her life and she fell to carousing <a
      href="#linknote-607" name="linknoteref-607" id="linknoteref-607"><small>607</small></a>
      with him. Now she was unique in eloquence and sweetness of speech and she
      proceeded to beguile him and bespeak him with words significant <a
      href="#linknote-608" name="linknoteref-608" id="linknoteref-608"><small>608</small></a>
      and sweet, so she might entangle him yet straitlier in the toils of her
      love. The Maugrabin thought that all this was true <a href="#linknote-609"
      name="linknoteref-609" id="linknoteref-609"><small>609</small></a> and
      knew not that the love she professed to him was a snare set for him to
      slay him. So he redoubled in desire for her and was like to die for love
      of her, when he saw from her that which she showed him of sweetness of
      speech and coquetry; <a href="#linknote-610" name="linknoteref-610"
      id="linknoteref-610"><small>610</small></a> his head swam with ecstasy <a
      href="#linknote-611" name="linknoteref-611" id="linknoteref-611"><small>611</small></a>
      and the world became changed <a href="#linknote-612" name="linknoteref-612"
      id="linknoteref-612"><small>612</small></a> in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they came to the last of the supper and the princess knew that the
      wine had gotten the mastery in his head, she said to him, "We have in our
      country a custom, meknoweth not if you in this country use it or not."
      "And what is this custom?" asked the Maugrabin. "It is," answered she,
      "that, at the end of supper, each lover taketh the other's cup and
      drinketh it." So saying, she took his cup and filling it for herself with
      wine, bade the handmaid give him her cup, wherein was wine mingled with
      henbane, even as she had taught her how she should do, for that all the
      slaves and slave-girls in the palace wished his death and were at one
      against him with the Lady Bedrulbudour. So the damsel gave him the cup,
      and he, hearing the princess's words and seeing her drink in his cup and
      give him to drink in hers, deemed himself Iskender of the Horns, whenas he
      saw from her all this love. Then she bent towards him, swaying gracefully
      from side to side, and laying her hand on his, said, "O my life, here is
      thy cup with me and mine is with thee; thus do lovers drink one from
      other's cup." Then she kissed <a href="#linknote-613"
      name="linknoteref-613" id="linknoteref-613"><small>613</small></a> his cup
      and drinking it off, set it down and came up to him and kissed him on the
      cheek; <a href="#linknote-614" name="linknoteref-614" id="linknoteref-614"><small>614</small></a>
      whereat he was like to fly for joy and purposing to do even as she had
      done, raised the cup to his mouth and drank it all off, without looking if
      there were aught therein or not; but no sooner had he done this than he
      turned over on his back, like a dead man, and the cup fell from his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lady Bedrulbudour rejoiced at this and the damsels ran, vying with
      each other in their haste, <a href="#linknote-615" name="linknoteref-615"
      id="linknoteref-615"><small>615</small></a> and opened the palace-door <a
      href="#linknote-616" name="linknoteref-616" id="linknoteref-616"><small>616</small></a>
      to Alaeddin, their lord; whereupon he entered and <a href="#linknote-617"
      name="linknoteref-617" id="linknoteref-617"><small>617</small></a> going
      up to his wife's pavilion, <a href="#linknote-618" name="linknoteref-618"
      id="linknoteref-618"><small>618</small></a> found her sitting at the table
      and the Maugrabin before her, as one slain. So he went up to the princess
      and kissed her and thanked her for this [that she had done] and rejoiced
      with an exceeding joy. Then said he to her, "Get thee now into thine inner
      chamber, thou and thy damsels, and leave me alone, so I may consider of
      that which I have to do." Accordingly, the Lady Bedrulbudour tarried not,
      but entered the inner pavilion, she and her women; whereupon Alaeddin
      arose and locked the door on them and going up to the Maugrabin, put his
      hand to his sleeve and pulled out the lamp; after which he drew his sword
      and cut off the sorcerer's head. Then he rubbed the lamp and the Marid,
      its slave, appeared to him and said, "Here am I, O my lord; what wiliest
      thou?" Quoth Alaeddin, "I will of thee that thou take up this palace from
      this country and carry it to the land of China and set it in the place
      where it was erst, before the Sultan's palace." "Hearkening and obedience,
      O my lord," replied the Marid [and disappeared], whilst Alaeddin went in
      and sat with the Lady Bedrulbudour his bride and embraced her and kissed
      her and she him; and they sat talking and making merry, what while the
      Marid took up the palace with <a href="#linknote-619"
      name="linknoteref-619" id="linknoteref-619"><small>619</small></a> them
      and set it down in its place before the Sultan's palace.

      Presently Alaeddin called for food; so the slave-girls set the tray before
      him and he sat, he and the Lady Bedrulbudour his wife, and ate and drank
      in all joy and gladness till they had taken their sufficiency. Then they
      removed to the chamber of wine and carousel, where they sat drinking and
      making merry and kissing one another with all eagerness, for that it was
      long since they had had easance together; and they ceased not from this
      till the sun of wine rose in their heads and sleep took them; whereupon
      they arose and lay down on their bed in all rest and delight. In the
      morning Alaeddin arose and aroused his wife, whereupon her women came to
      her and dressed her and busked her and adorned her; whilst he, on his
      part, donned the richest of raiment, <a href="#linknote-620"
      name="linknoteref-620" id="linknoteref-620"><small>620</small></a> and
      both were like to fly for joy at their reunion with each other, after
      their separation, whilst the Lady Bedrulbudour was especially glad, for
      that she looked to see her father that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for Alaeddin and the Lady Bedrulbudour; and as for the Sultan,
      after he had released Alaeddin, he ceased not to mourn for the loss of his
      daughter and to sit and weep for her, like a woman, at every time and
      tide; for that she was his only one and he had none other than her. And
      every day, whenas he arose from his sleep in the morning, he would go
      hastily to the window and opening it, look towards the place where
      Alaeddin's palace was erst and weep till his eyes were dried up and their
      lids ulcered. He arose that day at dawn, according to his wont, and
      opening the window, looked out and saw before him a building; so he fell
      to rubbing his eyes and looking closelier, was certified that it was
      Alaeddin's palace; whereupon he immediately called for the horses.
      Accordingly, they saddled them and he went down and mounting, rode to
      Alaeddin's palace. When the latter saw him coming, he went down and
      meeting him half-way, took him by the hand and carried him up to the
      pavilion of the Lady Bedrulbudour, his daughter. Now she also longed sore
      for her father; so she came down and met him at the stair-foot door, over
      against the lower hall; whereupon he embraced her and fell to kissing her
      and weeping and on this wise did she also. Then Alaeddin brought them up
      to the upper pavilion, <a href="#linknote-621" name="linknoteref-621"
      id="linknoteref-621"><small>621</small></a> where they sat down and the
      Sultan proceeded to question the princess of her case and of that which
      had befallen her, whilst <a href="#linknote-622" name="linknoteref-622"
      id="linknoteref-622"><small>622</small></a> she acquainted him with all
      that had happened to her and said to him, "O my father, I breathed not
      till yesterday, when I saw my husband, and he it is who delivered me from
      the bondage of a Maugrabin, an accursed sorcerer, methinketh there is not
      a filthier than he on the face of the earth; and but for my beloved
      Alaeddin, I had not won free of him and thou hadst not seen me all thy
      life. Indeed, O my father, there possessed me grief and sore chagrin, not
      only for my severance from thee, but also for the loss of my husband, to
      whom I shall be beholden all the days of my life, seeing he delivered me
      from that accursed enchanter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she went on to acquaint her father with all that had befallen her and
      to tell him of the Maugrabin's dealings and what he did with her and how
      he feigned himself a lampseller, who bartered new for old. "And when,"
      [quoth she]; "I saw this [seeming] lack of wit in him, I fell to laughing
      at him, unknowing his perfidy and his intent; so I took an old lamp that
      was in my husband's pavilion and sent it by the eunuch, who exchanged it
      with him for a new lamp; and next day, O my father, at daybreak, we found
      ourselves in Africa, with the palace and all that was therein; and I knew
      not the properties of the lamp which I had exchanged, till my husband
      Alaeddin came to us and contrived against the Maugrabin a device whereby
      he delivered us from him. Now, except my husband had won to us, it was the
      accursed one's intent to go in to me perforce; but Alaeddin, my husband
      gave me a powder, the which I put for him in a cup of wine and gave it him
      to drink. So he drank it and fell-back as one dead; whereupon my husband
      Alaeddin came in to me and meknoweth not how he wrought, so that he
      transported us back from the land of Africa to our place here." And
      Alaeddin said to the Sultan, "O my lord, when I came up and saw him cast
      down like one slain and sleeping for the henbane, I said to the Lady
      Bedrulbudour, 'Go in, thou and thy women, to the inner pavilion.' So she
      arose and went in, she and her damsels, from that loathsome sight; whilst
      I went up to the accursed Maugrabin and putting my hand to his sleeve,
      pulled out the lamp, for that the Lady Bedrulbudour had told me he still
      carried it there. Then, when I had gotten it, I drew my sword and cut
      [off] the accursed's [head] and making use of the lamp, bade its servants
      take us up, with the palace and all that was therein, and set us down here
      in our place. And if Thy Grace be in doubt of my words, do thou come with
      me and see the accursed Maugrabin."
    </p>
    <p>
      So the King arose and going in with Alaeddin to the pavilion, saw the
      Maugrabin [Iying ]: whereupon he bade forthright take the carcase and burn
      it and scatter its ashes [to the winds]. Then he embraced Alaeddin and
      fell to kissing him and said to him, "Excuse me, O my son, for that I was
      going <a href="#linknote-623" name="linknoteref-623" id="linknoteref-623"><small>623</small></a>
      to bereave thee of thy life, through the wickedness of yonder accursed
      sorcerer who cast thee into this pit; and indeed, O my son, I was
      excusable in that which I did with thee, inasmuch as I saw myself bereft
      of my daughter and mine only one, who is dearer to me than my kingdom, and
      thou knowest how fathers' hearts yearn upon their children, more by token
      that I have but the Lady Bedrulbudour." And he went on to excuse himself
      to him and kiss him; and <a href="#linknote-624" name="linknoteref-624"
      id="linknoteref-624"><small>624</small></a> Alaeddin said to him, "O Lord
      of the Age, thou didst with me nothing contrary to the law and I also was
      guiltless of offence; but the thing came all of that vile Maugrabin
      enchanter." Then the Sultan bade decorate the city and hold festival and
      rejoicings and commanded the crier to cry in the city that that day was a
      great festival, wherefore rejoicings should be holden in all the realm
      during the space of a month, [to wit,] thirty days' time, for the return
      of the Lady Bedrulbudour his daughter and her husband Alaeddin.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, then, is what befell Alaeddin with the Maugrabin; but Alaeddin, for
      all this, was not altogether <a href="#linknote-625" name="linknoteref-625"
      id="linknoteref-625"><small>625</small></a> quit of the accursed
      enchanter, withal his body had been burned and given to the winds; for
      that the accursed one had a brother viler than he [and yet more skilled]
      in magic and geomancy and astrology; [nay, they were even] as saith the
      proverb, "A bean and it was cloven in twain;" <a href="#linknote-626"
      name="linknoteref-626" id="linknoteref-626"><small>626</small></a> and
      each dwelt in one quarter of the world, so they might fill it <a
      href="#linknote-627" name="linknoteref-627" id="linknoteref-627"><small>627</small></a>
      with their sorcery and craft and guile. It chanced one day that the
      Maugrabin's brother was minded to know how it was with his brother; so he
      fetched his sand-board and smote it and extracted its figures; then he
      considered them and examining them throughly, found his brother in the
      house of the tomb; <a href="#linknote-628" name="linknoteref-628"
      id="linknoteref-628"><small>628</small></a> whereat he mourned and was
      certified that he was indeed dead. Then he smote the sand a second time,
      so he might learn how and where he died, and found that he had died in the
      land of China and by the foulest of deaths and knew that he who slew him
      was a youth by name Alaeddin. So he rose at once and equipping himself for
      travel, set out and traversed plains and deserts and mountains months and
      months, till he came to the land of China [and entering] the city of the
      sultanate, wherein was Alaeddin, repaired to the Strangers' Khan, where he
      hired him a lodging and rested there a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he arose to go round about the thoroughfares of the city, that he
      might spy him out a means of compassing his fell purpose, the which was to
      take vengeance of his brother on Alaeddin. So he entered a coffee-house in
      the market, a mighty fine place whither there resorted great plenty of
      folk, some to play tables, <a href="#linknote-629" name="linknoteref-629"
      id="linknoteref-629"><small>629</small></a> some draughts <a
      href="#linknote-630" name="linknoteref-630" id="linknoteref-630"><small>630</small></a>
      and other some chess and what not else. There he sat down and heard those
      who sat beside him talk of an old woman, an anchoress, by name Fatimeh,
      who still abode in her place without the city, serving [God], and came not
      down into the town but two days in the month, avouching her to be
      possessed of divine gifts galore. <a href="#linknote-631"
      name="linknoteref-631" id="linknoteref-631"><small>631</small></a> When
      the Maugrabin enchanter heard this, he said in himself, "Now have I found
      that which I sought. An it please God the Most High, I shall achieve my
      quest by means of this woman." So <a href="#linknote-632"
      name="linknoteref-632" id="linknoteref-632"><small>632</small></a> he went
      up to the folk who were speaking of the devout old woman's supernatural
      powers and said to one of them, "O uncle, I hear you talk of the divine
      gifts of one she-saint, <a href="#linknote-633" name="linknoteref-633"
      id="linknoteref-633"><small>633</small></a> by name Fatimeh. Who <a
      href="#linknote-634" name="linknoteref-634" id="linknoteref-634"><small>634</small></a>
      is she and where is her place?" "Wonderful!" cried the man. "What, thou
      art in our city and hast not heard of the divine gifts of my Lady <a
      href="#linknote-635" name="linknoteref-635" id="linknoteref-635"><small>635</small></a>
      Fatimeh? Apparently, good man, <a href="#linknote-636"
      name="linknoteref-636" id="linknoteref-636"><small>636</small></a> thou
      art a stranger, since thou hast never chanced to hear of the fasts of this
      holy woman and her abhorrence of the world and the goodliness of her
      piety." "Ay, my lord," replied the Maugrabin, "I am indeed a stranger and
      arrived but yesternight in this your town; wherefore I beseech thee tell
      me of the divine gifts of this holy woman and where her place is, for that
      I have fallen into a calamity and would fain go to her and crave her of
      prayer, so haply God (to whom belong might and majesty) may deliver me
      from my stress, by means of her intercession." The man accordingly told
      him of the divine gifts of the holy woman Fatimeh and her piety and the
      excellence of her devotion; then, taking him by the hand, he carried him
      without the city and showed him the way to her abiding-place, which was in
      a cavern on the top of a little hill; whereupon the Maugrabin thanked him
      amain for his kindness and returned to his place in the Khan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, by the decree of destiny, Fatimeh came down on the morrow to the city
      and the enchanter, going forth the Khan in the morning, saw the folk
      crowding together; so he went up, to see what was toward, and found
      Fatimeh standing, whilst every one who had a pain or an ache came to her,
      seeking her blessing and soliciting her prayers, and whenas she stroked
      him, he was made whole of his ailment. The Maugrabin followed her, till
      she returned to her cavern, and waited till nightfall, when he arose and
      entering a sherbet-sellers <a href="#linknote-637" name="linknoteref-637"
      id="linknoteref-637"><small>637</small></a> shop, drank a cup of liquor,
      <a href="#linknote-638" name="linknoteref-638" id="linknoteref-638"><small>638</small></a>
      then went forth the city, intending for the cavern of Fatimeh the recluse.
      When he came thither, he entered and saw her sleeping on her back on a
      piece of matting; so he went up to her and sitting down <a
      href="#linknote-639" name="linknoteref-639" id="linknoteref-639"><small>639</small></a>
      on her breast, <a href="#linknote-640" name="linknoteref-640"
      id="linknoteref-640"><small>640</small></a> drew his dagger and cried out
      at her; whereupon she awoke and opening her eyes, saw a man, a Maugrabin,
      with a drawn dagger, sitting on her breast <a href="#linknote-641"
      name="linknoteref-641" id="linknoteref-641"><small>641</small></a> and
      offering to kill her. So she feared and trembled and he said to her,
      "Harkye, an thou say aught or cry out, I will kill thee on the spot. Arise
      now and do all that I shall bid thee." And he swore an oath to her that,
      if she did for him that which he should bid her, he would not kill her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he rose from her and she rose also, and he said to her, "Give me thy
      clothes and take mine." So she gave him her clothes and head-bands and her
      kerchief and veil; and he said to her, "Now must thou anoint me, to boot,
      with somewhat, so my face may become like unto shine in colour."
      Accordingly Fatimeh went within the cavern and bringing out a vial of
      ointment, took thereof in her palm and anointed his face withal, whereupon
      it became like unto hers in colour. Then she gave him her staff and taught
      him how he should walk and how he should do, whenas he went down into the
      city; moreover, she put her rosary on his neck and finally giving him the
      mirror, said to him, "Look now; thou differest not from me in aught." So
      he looked and saw himself as he were Fatimeh herself. <a
      href="#linknote-642" name="linknoteref-642" id="linknoteref-642"><small>642</small></a>
      Then, when he had gotten his desire, he broke his oath and sought of her a
      rope; so she brought him a rope and he took her and strangled her
      therewith in the cavern. When she was dead, he dragged her forth and cast
      her into a pit therewithout; then, <a href="#linknote-643"
      name="linknoteref-643" id="linknoteref-643"><small>643</small></a>
      returning to her cavern, he slept there till the day broke, when he arose
      and going down into the city, came under Alaeddin's pavilion. <a
      href="#linknote-644" name="linknoteref-644" id="linknoteref-644"><small>644</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The folk gathered about him, believing him to be Fatimeh the Recluse, and
      he proceeded to do like as she had been used to do, laying hands on those
      in pain and reciting for this one the Fatiheh <a href="#linknote-645"
      name="linknoteref-645" id="linknoteref-645"><small>645</small></a> and for
      that a[nother] chapter of the Koran and praying for a third. Then, for the
      much crowding upon him and the clamour of the folk, the Lady Bedrulbudour
      heard and said to her women, "See what is to do and what is the cause of
      this noise." So the Ada of the eunuchs went to see what was toward and
      returning, said to her, "O my lady, this clamour is because of the Lady
      Fatimeh. An it please thee bid me fetch her to thee, so thou mayst ask a
      blessing of her...." And the Lady Bedrulbudour said to him, "Go and bring
      her to me; marry, this long while past I have still heard of her gifts and
      excellences and have yearned to see her, so I may ask a blessing of her,
      for that the folk are beyond measure abundant [in talk] of her [646]
      virtues." So the Aga went and brought the enchanter, disguised as Fatimeh,
      before the Lady Bedrulbudour; whereupon the Maugrabin offered up abundance
      of prayers for her, and none misdoubted of him but that he was Fatimeh the
      recluse. The princess rose and saluting him, seated him by her side and
      said to him, "O my Lady Fatimeh, I will have thee with me alway, that I
      may be blessed in thee and eke that I may learn of thee the ways of
      God-service and piety and model myself on thee."<a href="#linknote-646"
      name="linknoteref-646" id="linknoteref-646"><small>646</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this was what the accursed sorcerer aimed at; however, the better to
      accomplish his perfidious intent, <a href="#linknote-647"
      name="linknoteref-647" id="linknoteref-647"><small>647</small></a> he
      [dissembled and] said to her, "O my lady, I am a poor woman sitting in the
      desert and it beseemeth not that the like of me should abide in kings'
      palaces." Quoth the Lady Bedrulbudour, "Have no manner of care, O my lady
      Fatimeh; I will give thee a place in my house, where thou shalt do thy
      devotions, and none shall ever go in to thee; nay, here shalt thou serve
      God better than in thy cavern." And the Maugrabin said to her, "Hearkening
      and obedience, O my lady; I will not gainsay thy commandment, for that the
      speech of princes may not be crossed neither disputed; but I beg of thee
      that my eating and drinking and sitting may be in my closet alone [and]
      that none may come in upon me. Moreover, I need no rich viands, but every
      day do thou favour me and send me by thy handmaid a piece of bread and a
      draught of water to my closet; and when I am minded to eat, I will eat in
      my closet alone." (Now this the accursed did, of his fear lest his chin
      veil should be raised, when he ate, and so his case be exposed and they
      know him for a man by his beard and moustaches.) "O my lady Fatimeh,"
      rejoined the princess, "be easy; nothing shall betide save that which thou
      wiliest; so rise now [and come] with me, that I may show thee the pavilion
      <a href="#linknote-648" name="linknoteref-648" id="linknoteref-648"><small>648</small></a>
      which I purpose to order for thine inhabitance with us." So <a
      href="#linknote-649" name="linknoteref-649" id="linknoteref-649"><small>649</small></a>
      saying, she arose and carrying the sorcerer to the place which she had
      appointed him wherein to abide, said to him, "O my lady Fatimeh, here
      shalt thou dwell; this pavilion is in thy name and thou shalt abide
      therein in all quiet and ease of privacy." And the Maugrabin thanked her
      for her bounty and prayed for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Lady Bedrulbudour took him and showed him the belvedere <a
      href="#linknote-650" name="linknoteref-650" id="linknoteref-650"><small>650</small></a>
      and the kiosk of jewels, with the four-and-twenty oriels, <a
      href="#linknote-651" name="linknoteref-651" id="linknoteref-651"><small>651</small></a>
      and said to him, "How deemest thou, O my Lady Fatimeh, of this wonderful
      pavilion?" <a href="#linknote-652" name="linknoteref-652"
      id="linknoteref-652"><small>652</small></a> "By Allah, O my daughter,"
      replied he, "it is indeed marvellous in the extreme, <a
      href="#linknote-653" name="linknoteref-653" id="linknoteref-653"><small>653</small></a>
      nor methinketh is its like found in the world; nay, it is magnificent
      exceedingly; but oh, for one thing which would far increase it in beauty
      and adornment!" And the princess said to him, "O my Lady Fatimeh, what is
      lacking to it and what is this thing which would adorn it? Tell me of it;
      I had thought that it was altogether perfect." "O my lady," answered the
      sorcerer, "that which lacketh to it is the egg of the bird Roc, which
      being hung in its dome, there were no like unto this pavilion in all the
      world." "What is this bird." asked the princess, "and where shall we find
      its egg?" And the Moor said to her, "O my lady, this is a great bird that
      taketh up camels and elephants in its talons and flieth with them, of its
      bigness and greatness; it is mostly to be found in the mountain Caf and
      the craftsman who builded this palace <a href="#linknote-654"
      name="linknoteref-654" id="linknoteref-654"><small>654</small></a> is able
      to bring its egg." Then they left that talk and it was the time of the
      morning-meal. So the slave-girls laid the table and the Lady Bedrulbudour
      sat down and sought of the accursed sorcerer that he should eat with her;
      but he refused and rising, entered the pavilion which she had given him,
      whither the slave-girls carried him the morning-meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was eventide and Alaeddin returned from the chase, the Lady
      Bedrulbudour met him and saluted him: whereupon he embraced her and kissed
      her and looking in her face, saw that she was somewhat troubled and smiled
      not, against her wont. So he said to her, "What aileth thee, O my beloved?
      Tell me, hath there befallen thee aught to trouble thee?" And she answered
      him, saying, "There aileth me nothing; but, O my beloved, I had thought
      that our palace <a href="#linknote-655" name="linknoteref-655"
      id="linknoteref-655"><small>655</small></a> lacked of nought; however, O
      my eyes <a href="#linknote-656" name="linknoteref-656" id="linknoteref-656"><small>656</small></a>
      Alaeddin, were there hung in the dome of the upper pavilion <a
      href="#linknote-657" name="linknoteref-657" id="linknoteref-657"><small>657</small></a>
      an egg of the bird Roc, there were not its like in the world." "And wast
      thou concerned anent this?" rejoined Alaeddin. "This is to me the easiest
      of all things; so be easy, for it is enough that thou tell me of that
      which thou wishest and I will fetch it thee from the abysses of the world
      on the speediest wise." Then <a href="#linknote-658" name="linknoteref-658"
      id="linknoteref-658"><small>658</small></a> after he had comforted the
      princess and promised her all she sought, he went straight to his closet
      and taking the lamp rubbed it; whereupon the Marid at once appeared and
      said to him, "Seek what thou wilt;" and Alaeddin, "I will have thee bring
      me a Roc's egg and hang it in the dome of the [upper] pavilion." <a
      href="#linknote-659" name="linknoteref-659" id="linknoteref-659"><small>659</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Marid heard Alaeddin's words, his face frowned and he was wroth
      and cried out with a terrible great voice, saying, "O denier of benefits,
      doth it not suffice thee that I and all the slaves of the Lamp are at thy
      service and wouldst thou eke have me bring thee our liege lady, for thy
      pleasure, and hang her in the dome of thy pavilion, to divert thee and thy
      wife? By Allah, ye deserve that I should forthright reduce you both to
      ashes and scatter you to the winds! But, inasmuch as ye are ignorant, thou
      and she, concerning this matter and know not its inward from its outward,
      <a href="#linknote-660" name="linknoteref-660" id="linknoteref-660"><small>660</small></a>
      I excuse you, for that ye are innocent. As for the guilt, it lieth with
      the accursed one, the surviving <a href="#linknote-661"
      name="linknoteref-661" id="linknoteref-661"><small>661</small></a> brother
      of the Maugrabin enchanter, who feigneth himself to be Fatimeh the
      Recluse; for lo, he hath slain Fatimeh in her cavern and hath donned her
      dress and disguised himself after her favour and fashion and is come
      hither, seeking thy destruction, so he may take vengeance on thee for his
      brother; and he it is who taught thy wife to seek this of thee." <a
      href="#linknote-662" name="linknoteref-662" id="linknoteref-662"><small>662</small></a>
      Therewith he disappeared, and as for Alaeddin, when he heard this, his wit
      fled from his head and his joints trembled at the cry wherewith the Marid
      cried out at him; but he took heart and leaving his closet, went in
      straightway to his wife and feigned to her that his head irked him, of his
      knowledge that Fatimeh was renowned for the secret of healing <a
      href="#linknote-663" name="linknoteref-663" id="linknoteref-663"><small>663</small></a>
      all aches and pains. When the Lady Bedrulbudour saw him put his hand to
      his head and complain of its aching, <a href="#linknote-664"
      name="linknoteref-664" id="linknoteref-664"><small>664</small></a> she
      asked him what was the cause and he said, "I know not, except that my head
      irketh me sore." Accordingly she sent forthwith to fetch Fatimeh, so she
      might lay her hand on his head; whereupon quoth Alaeddin, "Who is this
      Fatimeh?" And the princess told him how she had lodged Fatimeh the recluse
      with her in the palace. <a href="#linknote-665" name="linknoteref-665"
      id="linknoteref-665"><small>665</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the slave-girls went and fetched the accursed Maugrabin, and
      Alaeddin arose to him, feigning ignorance of his case, and saluted him, as
      he had been the true Fatimeh. Moreover he kissed the hem of his sleeve and
      welcomed him, <a href="#linknote-666" name="linknoteref-666"
      id="linknoteref-666"><small>666</small></a> saying, "O my Lady Fatimeh, I
      beseech thee do me a kindness, since I know thy usances in the matter of
      the healing of pains, for that there hath betided me a sore pain in my
      head." The Maugrabin could scarce believe his ears of this speech, <a
      href="#linknote-667" name="linknoteref-667" id="linknoteref-667"><small>667</small></a>
      for that this was what he sought; so he went up to Alaeddin, as he would
      lay his hand on his head, after the fashion of Fatimeh the recluse, and
      heal him of his pain. When he drew near-him, he laid one hand on his head
      and putting the other under his clothes, drew a dagger, so <a
      href="#linknote-668" name="linknoteref-668" id="linknoteref-668"><small>668</small></a>
      he might slay him withal. But Alaeddin was watching him and waited till he
      had all to-drawn the dagger, when he gripped him by the hand and taking
      the knife from him, planted <a href="#linknote-669" name="linknoteref-669"
      id="linknoteref-669"><small>669</small></a> it in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Lady Bedrulbudour saw this, she cried out and said to him, "What
      hath this holy anchoress done, that thou burthenest thyself with the sore
      burden of her blood? Hast thou no fear of God, that thou dost this and
      hast slain Fatimeh, who was a holy woman and whose divine gifts were
      renowned?" Quoth he to her, "I have not slain Fatimeh; nay, I have slain
      him who slew her; for that this is the brother of the accursed Maugrabin
      enchanter, who took thee and by his sorcery transported the palace with
      thee to the land of Africa. Yea, this accursed one was his brother and
      came to this country and wrought these frauds, slaying Fatimeh and donning
      her clothes and coming hither, so he might take vengeance on me for his
      brother. Moreover, it was he who taught thee to seek of me a Roc's egg, so
      my destruction should ensue thereof; and if thou misdoubt of my word, come
      and see whom I have slain." So saying, he did off the Maugrabin's chin
      veil and the Lady Bedrulbudour looked and saw a man whose beard covered
      his face; whereupon she at once knew the truth and said to Alaeddin, "O my
      beloved, twice have I cast thee into danger of death;" and he said to her,
      "O Lady Bedrulbudour, thanks to thine eyes, <a href="#linknote-670"
      name="linknoteref-670" id="linknoteref-670"><small>670</small></a> no harm
      [hath betided me thereof; nay,] I accept with all joy everything that
      cometh to me through thee." When the princess heard this, she hastened to
      embrace him and kissed him, saying, "O my beloved, all this was of my love
      for thee and I knew not what I did; <a href="#linknote-671"
      name="linknoteref-671" id="linknoteref-671"><small>671</small></a> nor
      indeed am I negligent of thy love." <a href="#linknote-672"
      name="linknoteref-672" id="linknoteref-672"><small>672</small></a>
      Whereupon Alaeddin kissed her and strained her to his breast and love
      redoubled between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, in came the Sultan; so they told him of all that had passed
      with the Maugrabin enchanter's brother and showed him the latter, as he
      lay dead; whereupon he bade burn him and scatter his ashes to the winds.
      Thenceforward Alaeddin abode with his wife the Lady Bedrulbudour in all
      peace and pleasure and was delivered from all perils. Then, after a while,
      the Sultan died and Alaeddin sat down on the throne of the kingdom and
      ruled and did justice among the people; and all the folk loved him and he
      lived with his wife, the Lady Bedrulbudour, in all cheer and solace and
      contentment till there came to them the Destroyer of Delights and the
      Sunderer of Societies.

      the imperfection of the MS. used by him and (unable to obtain a more
      perfect copy) he seems to have endeavoured to supply the place of the
      missing portions by incorporating in his translation a number of Persian,
      Turkish and Arabic Tales, which had no connection with his original and
      for which it is generally supposed that he probably had recourse to
      Oriental MSS. (as yet unidentified) contained in the Royal Libraries of
      Paris." Vol. IX. p. 263. "Of these the Story of the Sleeper Awakened is
      the only one which has been traced to an Arabic original and is found in
      the Breslau edition of the complete work, printed by Dr. Habicht from a
      MS. of Tunisian origin, apparently of much later date than the other known
      copies.....Galland himself cautions us that the Stories of Zeyn Alasnam
      and Codadad do not belong to the Thousand and One Nights and were
      published (how he does not explain) without his authority." p. 264. "It is
      possible that an exhaustive examination of the various MS. copies of the
      Thousand and One Nights known to exist in the public libraries of Europe
      Might yet cast some light upon the origin of the interpolated tales; but,
      in view of the strong presumption afforded by internal evidence that they
      are of modern composition and form no part of the authentic text, it can
      hardly be expected, where the result and the value of that result are
      alike so doubtful, that any competent person will be found to undertake so
      heavy a task, except as incidental to some more general enquiry. The only
      one of the eleven which seems to me to bear any trace of possible
      connection with the Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night is Aladdin,
      and it may be that an examination of the MS. copies of the original work
      within my reach will yet enable me to trace the origin of that favourite
      story." pp. 268-9.]

      and masterly version, very inferior, in style, conduct and diction, to
      those of "the old Arabian Nights," whilst I think "Chavis and Cazotte's
      Continuation" utterly unworthy of republication, whether in part or "in
      its entirety." Indeed, I confess the latter version seems to me so
      curiously and perversely and unutterably bad that I cannot conceive how
      Cazotte can have perpetrated it and can only regard it as a bad joke on
      his part. As Caussin de Perceval remarks, it is evident that Shawish
      (whether from ignorance or carelessness) must, in many instances, have
      utterly misled his French coadjutor (who had no knowledge of Arabic) as to
      the meaning of the original, whilst it is much to be regretted that a
      writer of exquisite genius and one of the first stylists of the 18th
      century, such as the author of the Diable Amoureux, (a masterpiece to be
      ranked with Manon Lescaut and Le Neveu de Rameau,) should have stooped to
      the commission of the flagrant offences against good taste and artistic
      morality which disfigure well nigh every line of the so-called "Sequel to
      the 1001 Nights." "Far be it" (as the Arabs say) that we should do so
      cruel a wrong to so well and justly beloved a memory as that of Jacques
      Cazotte as to attempt to perpetuate the remembrance of a literary crime
      which one can hardly believe him to have committed in sober earnest!

      Zein-ud-din ul Asnam, i.e. Zein-ud-din (Adornment of the Faith) [he] of
      the Images, Zein (adornment) not being a name used by the Arabic-speaking
      races, unless with some such addition as ud-Din ("of the Faith"), and the
      affix ul Asnam ( "[He] of the Images") being a sobriquet arising from the
      circumstances of the hero's after-life, unless its addition, as
      recommended by the astrologers, is meant as an indication of the latter's
      fore-knowledge of what was to befall him thereafter. This noted, I leave
      the name as I find it in the Arabic MS.]

      was quite right, a staircase (and not a ladder) being, in my judgment,
      meant in each case, and Sir Richard Burton's translation of sullem min
      thelathin derejeh as "a ladder of thirty rungs" (see ante p. 82, note {see
      FN#231}) seems to me founded on a misconception, he being misled by the
      word "fihi" (see my note ante, p. 83 {see FN#235}). He adds, "sullem in
      modern Egyptian is used for a flight of steps;" but it signifies both
      "ladder" and "flight of steps" in the classic tongue; see Lane, p. 1416,
      colt 2, "sullem, a ladder or a series of stairs or steps, either of wood
      or clay, etc." His remark would apply better to derej (class. "a way," but
      in modern parlance "a ladder" or "staircase" which the story-teller uses
      interchangeably with sullem, in speaking of the stair leading down into
      the underground, thus showing that he considered the two words

      was killing him and waxed on him more and more when he saw the Sultan that
      he was satisfied with (or accepted of) the bride-gift and the dowry;
      however, it was not possible to him that he should gainsay the truth and
      should say to the Sultan, 'He is not worthy;' only, he practised with a
      device upon the Sultan so he should not let him give his daughter the Lady
      Bedrulbudour to Alaeddin, and this [Footnote was] that he said to him,
      etc,"&mdash;and also (2) the version given by Sir K. F. Burton, who takes
      a different view of the passage: "Then the Minister (although he marvelled
      at these riches even more than did the Sultan), whose envy was killing him
      and growing greater hour by hour, seeing his liege lord satisfied with the
      moneys and the dower and yet being unable to fight against fact, made
      answer, 'Tis not worthy of her.' Withal he fell to devising a device

      famous upper hall with the four-and-twenty windows is one of the most
      contused and incoherent parts of the Nights and well-nigh defies the
      efforts of the translator to define the exact nature of the building
      described by the various and contradictory passages which refer to it. The
      following is a literal rendering of the above passage: "An upper chamber
      (keszr) and (or?) a kiosk (kushk, a word explained by a modern Syrian
      dictionary as meaning '[a building] like a balcony projecting from the
      level of the rest of the house,' but by others as an isolated building or
      pavilion erected on the top of a house, i.e. a keszr, in its classical
      meaning of 'upper chamber,' in which sense Lane indeed gives it as
      synonymous with the Turkish koushk, variant kushk,) with four-and-twenty
      estrades (liwan, a raised recess, generally a square-shaped room, large or
      small, open on the side facing the main saloon), all of it of emeralds and
      rubies and other jewels, and one estrade its kiosk was not finished."
      Later on, when the Sultan visits the enchanted palace for the first time,
      Alaeddin "brought him to the high kiosk and he looked at the belvedere
      (teyyareh, a square or round erection on the top of a house, either open
      at the sides or pierced with windows, =our architectural term 'lantern')
      and its casements (shebabik, pl. of shubbak, a window formed of grating or
      lattice-work) and their lattices (she"ri for she"rir, pl. of sheriyyeh, a
      lattice), all wroughten of emeralds and rubies and other than it of
      precious jewels." The Sultan "goes round in the kiosk" and seeing "the
      casement (shubbak), which Alaeddin had purposely left defective, without
      completion," said to the Vizier, "Knowest thou the reason (or cause) of
      the lack of completion of this casement and its lattices?" (shearihi, or
      quaere, "[this] lattice," the copyist having probably omitted by mistake
      the diacritical points over the final ha). Then he asked Alaeddin, "What
      is the cause that the lattice of yonder kiosk (kushk) is not complete?"
      The defective part is soon after referred to, no less than four times, as
      "the lattice of the kiosk" (sheriyyetu 'l kushk), thus showing that, in
      the writer's mind, kushk, liwan and shubbak were synonymous terms for the
      common Arab projecting square-sided window, made of latticework, and I
      have therefore rendered the three words, when they occur in this sense, by
      our English "oriel," to whose modern meaning (a window that juts out, so
      as to form a small apartment), they exactly correspond. Again, in the
      episode of the Maugrabin's brother, the princess shows the latter
      (disguised as Fatimeh) "the belvedere (teyyarrh) and the kiosk (kushk) of
      jewels, the which [was] with (i.e. had) the four-and-twenty portals"
      (mejouz, apparently a Syrian variant of mejaz, lit. a place of passage,
      but by extension a porch, a gallery, an opening, here (and here only) used
      by synecdoche for the oriel itself), and the famous roe's egg is proposed
      to be suspended from "the dome (cubbeh) of the upper chamber" (el keszr el
      faucaniyy), thus showing that the latter was crowned with a dome or
      cupola. It is difficult to extricate the author's exact meaning from the
      above tangle of confused references; but, as far as can be gathered. in
      the face of the carelessness with which the text treats kushk as
      synonymous now with keszr or teyyareh and now with liwan or shubbak, it
      would seem that what is intended to be described is a lofty hall (or
      sorer), erected on the roof of the palace, whether round or square we
      cannot tell, but crowned with a dome or cupola and having four-and-twenty
      deep projecting windows or oriels, the lattice or trellis-work of which
      latter was formed (instead of the usual wood) of emeralds, rubies and
      other jewels, strung, we may suppose, upon rods of gold or other metal I
      have, at the risk of wearying my reader, treated this point at some
      length, as well because it is an important one as to show the almost
      insuperable difficulties that beset the. conscientious translator at
      well-nigh every page of such works as the "Book of the Thousand Nights and
      One Night."]

      primary and secondary figures. The following account of the geomantic
      process, as described by Arabic writers de re magicf, is mainly derived
      from the Mukeddimat or Prolegomena of Abdurrehman ibn Aboubekr Mohammed
      (better known as Ibn Khaldoun) to his great work of universal history.
      Those (says he) who seek to discover hidden things and know the future
      have invented an art which they call tracing or smiting the sand; to wit,
      they take paper or sand or flour and trace thereon at hazard four rows of
      points, which operation, three times repeated (i.e. four times performed),
      gives sixteen rows. These points they eliminate two by two, all but the
      last (if the number of the points of a row be odd) or the last two (if it
      be even) of each row, by which means they obtain sixteen points, single or
      double. These they divide into four figures, each representing the
      residual points of four lines, set one under another, and these four
      figures, which are called the mothers or primaries, they place side by
      side in one line. From these primaries they extract four fresh figures by
      confronting each point with the corresponding point in the next figure,
      and counting for each pair a single or double point, according to one of
      two rules, i.e. (1) setting down a single point for each single point
      being on the same line with another point, whether single or double, and a
      double point for. each pair of double points in line with each other, or
      (2) reckoning a double point for each pair of like points (single or
      double), corresponding one with another on the same line' and a single
      point for each, unlike pair. These new figures (as well as those that
      follow) are called the daughters or secondaries and are placed beside the
      primaries, by confrontation with which (i,e, 5 with 1, 6 with 2, 7 with 3
      and with 4) four fresh figures are obtained after the same fashion and
      placed side by side below the first eight. From this second row a
      thirteenth and fourteenth figure are obtained in the same way (confronting
      9 with lo and 1 l with 12) and placed beneath them, as a third row. The
      two new figures, confronted with each other, in like manner, furnish a
      fifteenth figure, which, being confronted with the first of the primaries,
      gives a sixteenth and last figure, completing the series. Then (says our
      author), the geomant proceeds to examine the sixteen figures thus obtained
      (each of which has its name and its mansion, corresponding to one of the
      twelve signs of the zodiac or the four cardinal points, as well as its
      signification, good or bad, and indicates also, in a special way, a
      certain part of the elemental world) and to note each figure according to
      its presage of weal or ill; and so, with the aid of an astrological table
      giving the explanations of the various signs and combinations, according
      to the nature of the figure, its aspect, influence and temperament
      (astrologically considered) and the natural object it indicates, a
      judgment is formed upon the question for a solution of which the operation
      was undertaken. I may add that the board or table of sand (tekht reml), so
      frequently mentioned in the Nights, is a shallow box filled with fine
      sand, carefully levelled, on which the points of the geomantic operation
      are made with a style of wood or metal. (The name tekht reml is however
      now commonly applied to a mere board or tablet of wood on which the
      necessary dots are made with ink or chalk. ) The following scheme of a
      geomantic operation will show the application of the above rules.
      Supposing the first haphazard dotting to produce these sixteen rows of
      points,

  4.......   (7)  8.....   (5) 12.......   (7)  16.....    (5)

 By the process of elimination we get the following four primaries:

 Fig. 1  x    Fig. 2  x x    Fig. 3  x    Fig. 4  x x
         x            x x           x x           x x

 The process of confrontation of the corresponding points of these
 four figures (according to rule 2) gives the following four
 secondaries:

        x x           x x           x x           x x

 By confrontation of the points of each secondary with those of
 its corresponding primary, the following four fresh figures are
 obtained:

   Which, in its turn, confronted with Fig. 1, gives a sixteenth
 and last figure,                                             x

      boisson chance qui luy etoit connue des son premier voyage. Il n'y e-t pas

      qu'on la luy presenta. En la prenant, comme il prestoit l'oreille...

      The Chavis MS. says, "He entered a coffee-house (kehweh, Syrian for
      kehawi), and there used to go in thereto all the notables of the city, and
      he heard a company, all of them engaged in (ammalin bi, a very vulgar
      expression) talking of the Amir Alaeddin's palace, etc." This (or a
      similar text) is evidently the original of Galland's translation of this
      episode and it is probable, therefore, that the French translator inserted
      the mention "of a certain warm drink"(tea), out of that mistaken desire
      for local colouring at all costs which has led so many French authors
      (especially those of our own immediate day) astray. The circumstance was
      apparently evolved (alla tedesca) from his inner consciousness, as,

      with the head-seller or dealer in heads, etc." The word here employed
      (rewwas) commonly signifies "a man who cooks and sells sheepsheads,
      oxheads, etc." M. Zotenberg makes the following note on this passage in.
      his edition of Alaeddin; "Rewwas (for raa"s) signifies not only 'he who
      sells cooked heads,' but also 'he who makes a business of cooking heads.'
      Consequently whoso entrusteth a head to the rewwas is preoccupied and
      sleeps not." M. Zotenberg's note is unintelligible, in consequence of his
      having neglected to explain that the passage in question is a common
      Egyptian proverb, meaning (says Burckhardt), "the person whose fortune is
      entrusted to the hands of strangers cannot enjoy repose." "The poor," adds
      he, "at Cairo buy sheepsheads and for a trifle have them boiled in the
      bazaar by persons who are not only cooks, but sellers of sheepsheads, and
      are therefore called raa"s, or in the Egyptian dialect rewwas." The
      proverb is in the present case evidently meant as a play upon the literal
      meaning ("headsman," hence by implication "executioner") of the word
      rewwas, although I cannot find an instance of the word being employed in
      this sense. It is, however, abundantly evident from the general context
      that this is the author's intention in the passage in question, Alaeddin's
      head being metaphorically in the hands of (or pledged to) the headsman,
      inasmuch as he had engaged to return and suffer decapitation in case he
      should not succeed in recovering the princess within forty days.]

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
